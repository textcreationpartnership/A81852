            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>SINCE the only End and Deſign of Jeſus Chriſts coming down from Heaven, and all the Circumſtances of his Incarnation, his Birth, Life, Preaching, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, was to procure Salvation for Men; It is highly reaſonable, that they ſhould fully underſtand all thoſe Myſteries, which are contained in the great Work of their Redemption, and be well verſed in the Hiſtory of that Life, and Death, from which they receive ſo great Advantage. They were Enemies to God: <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ hath made a compleat ſatisfaction to his Father by his Death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 5.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and by his Diſcourſes and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath Taught them what they ought to do; return unto him.</hi> They can never ſufficiently meditate upon the Sufferings, which the Son of God endured to expiate their Guilts, that they may make a grateful acknowledgment of them, by an unfeigned Love of him; nor upon thoſe Truths which he hath Taught them, and exemplified by his own practice, ſince we muſt be ſaved by the obſervation of thoſe Truths, and Imitation of his Actions.</p>
               <p>For this Reaſon it is, that the Church of God in all Ages hath been ſo urgent with Chriſtians, to
<pb facs="tcp:154149:4"/> receive the Holy Sacrament frequently, it being a lively repreſentation of his Death, and of the Sacrifice, which he offered upon the Croſs for a propitiation to God, and our frequent uſe of it, being an Authentick Teſtimony of our Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God for his Goodneſs. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is called the Euchariſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. But becauſe we cannot obtain that Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us by his Death, but by the exact obſervation of thoſe Laws, he hath impoſed upon us, and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Example he hath left us, he requires his Miniſters before the receiving of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to Inſtruct Men well, both in the Precepts of the Goſpel, and in the Actions of the Son of God. And by this he ſhews, that there is nothing that he recommends ſo much to his Children, as to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon, and get a full knowledge of the Life and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, either that they may give him thanks continually for what he hath done and ſuffered for them, or know by what he hath done, what they ought to do themſelves; for all his whole Life, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is but one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Instruction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de ver. Rel. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>how we ſhould lead our Lives; and we never commit any Sin, but by departing from his Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that the Goſpels are the moſt exact Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Life and Death of Chriſt; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them all that God hath thought fit to make known to us, concerning the Actions and Doctrins of his Son. And Men can never be too much Importun'd to Read thoſe Books diligently, which contain in them thoſe Truths, by which they muſt be judged at the Laſt Day: But ſince it is very conducible to the Right Underſtanding of the Scripture-Relation concerning Chriſt to have the Hiſtory of his Life, lay'd down in a continued draught, according to the Order of Time, and with all the Circumſtances of it,
<pb facs="tcp:154149:4"/> which none of the Evageliſts have done, I thought I might do ſome ſervice to the Church of God, in general, and to more ignorant and weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in particular, in compoſing a ſhort, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Harmony of the Goſpels.</p>
               <p>And in my performing this undertaking, I have had ſpecial care to relate nothing but the Truth, avoiding all Traditional Stories, and confining my ſelf ſtrictly to the Relations of the Evangelical Writers; and have adventured to put in nothing of my own, but the Style and Expreſſion, that I might render the Senſe and Phraſe of Scripture more eaſie and intelligible to the moſt ordinary capacities. And that nothing be difficult to them, I have obſerved theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. I have related the Actions of Jeſus Chriſt with all their Circumſtances: But as to his Sermons, and Diſcourſes, I have ſet down only ſo much of them, as are moſt eaſie to be underſtood, and neceſſary to know, for the improvement of our Manners. I am ſenſible, that the Sermons of our Saviour make up a great part of his Life, and that the Truths he Taught are as neceſſary to be known as the Actions he did; but ſince ſeveral of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, eſpecially ſuch as concern the proof of his Divinity, are ſcarcely intelligible by any but the Learned, I have touched, but lightly upon them, and choſe to ſet down more largely thoſe Truths which are eſſential, and of Univerſal concern for all Mens Salvation, which as I have expreſſed in ſhort, ſo alſo in ſuch words as may render them more Intelligible to the People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Altho' I deſigned to ſpeak of nothing, but what is in the Goſpel, and that I might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to add any thing, have choſen to relate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is obſcure or controverſal, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have been forced to tranſgreſs theſe bounds meeting with ſomething which could not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:154149:5"/> tho' difficult, upon which account I have added ſome explications of them. Jeſus Chriſt hath Taught many Moral Truths in Metaphors and Parables, which are very important for all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to know, but uſeleſs, and ſome times dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unleſs they be accompanyed with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, which may help the Reader in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and applying them. For this reaſon we have intermixed ſome explications without breaking the Series of the Hiſtory, to clear that which is obſcure, ſweeten that which is harſh, and ſo prepare the Bread of Truth, that it may nouriſh the weak, as well as the ſtrong; tho' theſe obſervations and remarks are very rare, ſhort and eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the Relations of the Evangeliſts, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, will be thought neceſſary for the moſt part by the Reader, who will think them rather too few, than too many.</p>
               <p>But conſidering that unleſs we well underſtand the deſign of our Saviours coming into the World, we cannot read the Hiſtory of his Life with any real advantage; for ſince he did, ſpake and ſuffered nothing, but with a tendency to that end, we can never have a true notion of them, unleſs we know the true motive, and the end which he himſelf aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; I judged it neceſſary to propound a ſhort Hiſtory of the Fall of Man, and the Wounds which Men have received by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before I preſent them with the Medicine to heal them, and teach them in a few words the happineſs of that Eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God Created them, the lamentable Miſeries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they have faln by Sin, and the means, which Gods infinite goodneſs makes uſe of to ſave them. The Diſcovery of theſe Miſeries will make them more deſirous to know what Chriſt hath done to deliver them; and by how much they perceive themſelves more obnoxious to Gods Juſtice, by ſo much they will the more eagerly lay hold
<pb facs="tcp:154149:5"/> upon Jeſus by Faith to ſave them from it.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> Mans Creation, and Fall by Sin.</head>
               <p>When God created the Heaven and the Earth in ſix days, he being deſirous not only to provide a Governour for all his Corporeal Creatures, but to put ſome other Beings into the places of the faln An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, Created a Man and Woman, whom he called <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which ſignifies the Mother of all Living. God formed them in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, <hi>i. e.</hi> gave them an Immortal Soul, endowed them with abilities, to know and love him, which are two of the moſt noble Actions of the Rational Creature, which make up the whole Life, and happineſs of God, which is to know, and love himſelf from all Eternity. Wherefore he filled their Minds with Knowledge, and their Will with Love. He Created them perfect and upright, their Souls in perfect ſubmiſſion to God, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their Soul. There was no darkneſs, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their minds, becauſe God was their Light and Peace; and nothing in there Bodies, which might make them aſhamed, becauſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſorderly; for which reaſon it is, that the Holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>That they were Naked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.25.</note> 
                  <hi>and were not aſhamed.</hi> In this Holy and Happy Eſtate they had a ſound Judgment and perfect freedom of Will, furniſhed with all Graces neceſſary to do that good which God required of them, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that Glory, which ſhould be the reward of their Virtue, which is to have a clear Viſion of God. They knew ſo much of God, as Creatures are capable of; and if they made a good uſe of this knowledge upon Earth, they ſhould be Tranſlated to the full fruition of God in Heaven. Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency exempted them from Death, and all other Evils, which are the effects of Sin. And their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges were not only for themſelves, but their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb facs="tcp:154149:6"/> to whom they ſhould communicate not only their Nature, but Innocency and all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it.</p>
               <p>For the continuance of all theſe Temporal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and obtaining that eternal happineſs, which he hath promiſed them, God required nothing, but an entire ſubmiſſion to his Will, which that he might have tryal of, he gave them a Command to abſtain from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, which was in the midſt of Paradiſe, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with Death, if they dared to Touch it. Nothing was more eaſy than the obſervation of this Commandment; but they kept it not long; for the Devil envying their Happineſs, came to <hi>Eve</hi> under the Shape of a Serpent, perſwading her to Eat the Fruit which was forbidden, and telling her, that they ſhould be ſo far from dying, that they ſhall become as Gods. By theſe promiſes ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be ſeduced, eat of the Fruit, and gave it to her Husband, who thro' a wicked Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made himſelf guilty of the Womans Sin.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had thus broken the Command of their God, they were made ſenſible of their Fault by the fearful Change in themſelves; for they perceived they were Naked, and were filled with confuſion, becauſe they felt in their Bodies the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Motions of their Concupiſcence. God ſhewed himſelf to them no longer as a Father, whoſe preſence was their Joy and Happineſs; but as an offended Lord, who reproved their diſobedience and as a ſevere Judge to puniſh their Rebellion, He Condemned the Man to Toil and Drudgery, for his neceſſary Food, the Woman to Pains in Child-bearing, and drave them both out of the Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Paradiſe, in which he had placed them; he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them to all the miſeries of this Life, and paſſed the ſentence of Death upon them, which he
<pb facs="tcp:154149:6"/> had threatned, condemning them not only to a Temporal Death of the Body, but to the Second Death, which is more terrible than the former, the Death of the Soul, which is to Live eternally with the Devils in Hell, and be baniſhed from the only cauſe and foundation of all Happineſs, God. <hi>A just puniſhment,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Austin for their fault in diſobeying ſo eaſy a Law of ſo great a God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> being corrupted in him, as in their Fountain and Root by his Sin, was alſo lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame puniſhment; for as if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his Innocency, all his Poſterity had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited it by their Birth, and all the Advantages of it; after the ſame manner, ſince he hath ſinned, all Men naturally inherit his Crimes, and all the Plagues, which are conſequent upon it. This is the Sin, which we call Original, becauſe we are guilty of it from our Original and Birth; and this is the Sin, which brings upon us all thoſe Evils, which we feel, either in our Souls or Bodies; for the darkneſs of the Underſtanding, the corruption of the Heart, the proneneſs of the Will to Evil, and Oppoſition to Good, the diſorderly Motions of Concupiſcence, the turbulency of our Paſſions, the exceſſive Love of our ſelves, forgetfulneſs and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, all the Sins which we commit, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirſt, Wearineſs, Griefs, Death, and Laſtly, Eternal Damnation, are the ſad Conſequences and juſt puniſhments of this Sin, which we come into the World with, and which make us, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Children of the Wrath of God.</hi>

                  <hi>III.</hi> The Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
               <p>Out of the miſerable condition, into which Man had plunged himſelf and Poſterity by Sin, there was no way of Recovery, had not God in his
<pb facs="tcp:154149:7"/> infinite Mercy been pleaſed to find out a way, which none elſe could do. He had compaſſion on his Creatures, and contrived this means to ſave them, the Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Son of God, the Second Perſon of the Holy Trinity was made Incarnate, aſſuming a Body and Soul like us, and united to his Divinity in his own perſon the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he intended to redeem. He became Man, ſtill being God, and took upon him all the weakneſſes and Infirmities of Man, Sin and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance only excepted. He undertook to ſatisfie Juſtice for the Sin of Men, and to pacifie God for the offence committed againſt him by ſuffering himſelf for it. He condeſcended to be conceived by a Virgin, Born in a Stable, become an Infant, converſe with Men, and live among them ſuch a Life, as we ſhall hereafter relate. He preached, did Miracles, ſuffered Affronts and Injuries, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured an Infamous, and painful Death, was Buryed in a Tomb, roſe again, and Laſtly, aſcended into Heaven: After he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſciples to go, and Preach in his Name thro' all the World, and all this to perform and Compleat the Great Work of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Behold how great Love God hath ſhewed to Rebellious Man! The Father hath given his only Son, and this Son gave himſelf for them. Let no Man ask the reaſon, why God did not make choice of ſome eaſier way to ſave us, which might coſt him leſs. It is certain, that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could have found out ſome other means, but it is alſo certain that we ought to look upon this, which God hath made uſe of as the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for us, and moſt agreeable to our needs, ſince that God hath preferred it before all others, who is not only the moſt Powerful, but Wiſe Being, who cannot be miſtaken in the fitteſt means for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb facs="tcp:154149:7"/> the End he aims at. Let us not then examine, what other ways God might have taken to effect this Great Work, but let us devoutly conſider, how Glorious to himſelf, and how profitable to us, that way is which he hath taken.</p>
               <p>And 1ſt. God in the Incarnation of his Son hath magnified his Power and Goodneſs; for he hath demonſtrated to Man, that tho' he is pleaſed to permit the Evils, which he could hinder, he can produce great good out of them, and make thoſe very Sins, which diſhonour him, to be ſerviceable for his glory in it. He hath ſhewed his Mercy, and his Juſtice; for he pardons the Guilty, and at the ſame time he received a ſatisfaction equivalent to the Offence committed. By it he hath diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, the admirable and unſearchable ſtrength of his Wiſdom, which hath found out a way to ſatisfy at once, both his Juſtice and his Love, and hath ſo ordered it, that the Criminal may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet God, who hath been offended, not be diſhonoured; for by the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, God is revenged, and Mans Sin puniſhed. He bore our grief in his own Body, and offered ſuch a Sacrifice to his Father, as could not but be accepted becauſe it was Pure and Innocent, and which payd him as great honour, as he had received affront by Man's Sin; for it was of infinite value being united to the God-head. The perfect ſubmiſſion of the Son of God, even to the Death of the Croſs, hath made ſufficient amends for the Diſobedience of a mere Man. Men are ſaved, becauſe another hath undergone the puniſhment due to them; and God hath loſt nothing of his Honour, ſince he was offended by a mere Creature, but hath been infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Honoured by a God. And as it is glorious to God, ſo alſo is</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt as advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to Man, by the wonderful fitneſs, which it
<pb facs="tcp:154149:8"/> hath to all the defects and evils, from which the Divine Wiſdom hath thought fit to deliver him; for Gods anger was not only to be appeaſed, but Man, who was diſeaſed, was to be cured. Now as the perfection of Man conſiſted in knowing and loving God, ſo the diſeaſe of Man was to be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of theſe, ſo that he neither knew God, nor loved him, but laboured under blindneſs of Mind, and corruption of Heart, which Chriſt by his Incarnation hath removed and cured: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath reſtored Man to the knowledge of God. He hath opened the Eyes of Man, to make him know the true God; for the Word who is the Light of the Soul,<note place="margin">John 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>was made fleſh, and dwelt among us.</hi> The Light which we ſhut our Eyes againſt, came down from Heaven to preſent it ſelf to us, accommodating it ſelf to the weakneſs of our ſight, and becauſe we were able to diſcern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Corporeal things, he cloathed himſelf with a Body, that ſo by our Senſes he might inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelf into our Souls, and diſperſe our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and blindneſs. Jeſus Chriſt being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible, he converſed ſometime with Men, did Miracles to make them believe on him, and by ſenſible benefits, healing the Sick, freeing the Poſſeſſed, drawed them to him; and ſo having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly link'd them to his Human Nature, which he aſſumed, to work out Salvation for them, he Preached the Truth to them: They heard his Word with pleaſure, and this Word purifying their Hearts by Faith, which they had in this Man, who Preached to them, prepared them by little and little, and at laſt led them inſenſibly to the knowledge of the-God-head, which was hidden under the Vail of the Humanity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſince it is not enough for Man to know God, unleſs he Love him; Jeſus Chriſt by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation hath healed our corruption of Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:154149:8"/> and hath drawn our Affections off from the Love of the Creature, to that of the Creator; for being Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a Body, he placed his God-head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Objects, which the Soul in the State of Corruption doth naturally fix its Love upon, and by ſenſible benefits and kindneſſes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring it to the Conſideration and Love of Inviſible and Eternal good things. He ſhewed it, what it ought to love, as its true Happineſs, and not only raiſed its hopes to attain it, but Taught it the proper means of arriving at it. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He convinced it of the great Love God had for it, and conſequently, how much it ought to love him; for what greater ſign of love could he have given us, than in ſending his only begotten Son to Dye for us, who were his Enemies? And what more effectual Attracture to oblige us to love him again, who hath thus loved us firſt? What Heart is ſo hard as not to be melted with ſuch immenſe kindneſs? A ſlight reflection upon it will make us reſolve with the beloved Diſciple, and ſay, <hi>Let us Love God, for he hath firſt Loved us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jo. 4 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Incarnation of Chriſt, gives us an ample proof of Gods love to us, ſo alſo it ſhews us the greatneſs of the Crime, with which we have offended him. The greatneſs of the Satisfaction diſcovers the greatneſs of our Guilt. Man could never have conceived the heinouſneſs of his Sin, if God had not required ſo great a ſatisfaction. We uſually look upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as a ſmall ſin, and are apt to accuſe God of injuſtice for puniſhing a momentary Action, with eternal Torments; not conſidering, that the Perſon, who was threatned with eternal Torments for his Rebellion, might have enjoyed an eternal Happineſs for his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But the Incarnation of the Son of God hath juſtified the Juſtice of God; for his Blood, which was ſhed for the expiation of our Sin, is a faithful
<pb facs="tcp:154149:9"/> Mirrour to repreſent the greatneſs of our Crimes. By it we ſee how much our Offences diſpleaſed God, ſince he puniſheth it with Eternal Death, and for the Pardon of it, requires no leſs ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the abaſing Tortures and Death of the Son of God. Nor let us ſay, that if God loved Men ſo tenderly, he might have ſaved them without exacting of them ſo great a Satisfaction, as Jeſus Chriſt made; but let us think rather, that if God, notwithſtanding the love he hath for Man, would not ſave Man any other way than by the Death of his Son God-Man, he muſt need have an irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred to Sin, and of all Evil, that is moſt odious to him. This is none of the leaſt advantages which we may gain by the Incarnation of the Son of God, to raiſe in our ſelves a hatred of Sin, and a fear of loſing the benefit of our Reconciliation with God by our freſh Sins, by conſidering what it coſt to redeem us, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>We are not redeemed with Corruptible things, as Silver and Gold;</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:154149:9"/> this deſign, none was thought ſo ſuitable, as the Life and Converſe of Jeſus Chriſt with the Sons of Men; by which not only all the obſtacles of our Converſion are removed, but all the ſweetest allurements imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable are tendred to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are ignorant, what we ought to do to pleaſe God, and being blinded with the falſe Idea's of Good and Evil, are not ſenſible, that the only real Good of the Rational Soul is the enjoyment of God, and the only real Evil is the loſs of this Chief Good. All Men are involved in this Error, and therefore 'twas in vain to expect a better information from any mere Man; or if any had thoſe true notions of Mans happineſs, yet either Mans natural pride, or the differences of the Wiſe about it, would make us either ſlight our Teachers, or deny our aſſent, to what they Inſtruct us in, as dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p>That therefore we might be Inſtructed in this Truth without fear of being deceived, the Truth it ſelf came to diſpel our Darkneſs and enlighten our Ignorance, and hath tendred himſelf to us as a Maſter, whoſe Diſciples we need not be aſhamed to own our ſelves, becauſe this Maſter is our God. He was made Man, and dwelt among us. He hath proved to us by his admirable Miracles, That he was a Teacher ſent from God to Inſtruct us; that he is Gods only Son. Laſtly, that he is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Light and Truth, and having proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be God, he hath diſperſed the Rays of his Doctrin, and Taught by his Preaching, what is our true Happineſs, and what we muſt do to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
               <p>But he did not content himſelf to teach us; but joyned Example to his Inſtruction. He perſwaded us to the practiſe of thoſe Truths by his Actions, which he delivered in his Sermons. He preſcribed them fit Remedies for their Diſtempers, but becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:154149:10"/> they were bitter and unpleaſant, troubleſome and nauſeous for Men to take, he firſt took them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, altho' he had no need of them, that the ſick perſon might be more willing to take them after their Phyſician. We muſt be humble that we may be ſaved, and this was the way he took to perſwade the Proud to it. God might have commanded his Creatures to be humble, crying out from his Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Throne,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.3.</note> in Jeſus<hi>'s</hi> Words, <hi>Except ye hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hle your ſelves, and be converted, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> But God did not make choice of this way to bring Men to embrace this Virtue,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Ep.</hi> 42.</note> but made uſe, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, of a more effectual and taking way, more ſweet and pleaſant; he had rather root Pride out of our Hearts by perſwaſion, than force, and invite us to Humility by the example of the Son of God, who being humble and of no Reputation, ſaith unto us, <hi>Learn of me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.29.</note> 
                  <hi>for I am meek, and lowly in Heart.</hi> What arrogance can withſtand ſuch words as theſe, ſupported by infinite Dignity, and profound Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of the Speaker? And who will not think it now a greater ſhame for him to be elevated with Pride after the manner of Men, than to be humble and meek in imitation of the Son of God? And the ſame may be ſaid of all the Virtues neceſſary for Mans Converſion, which I have ſaid of Humility; for whereas there is nothing more prevalent with Men, than Example; Jeſus Chriſt hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an exact Pattern for them, and for this cauſe hath propounded his Life to us, that he lived upon Earth as an exact Pattern of our matters.</p>
               <p>Sin hath ſeparated us from God, and ſetting us at a diſtance from him, puts us out of a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of returning to him. We are carryed by our Affections, which are ſo far from leading us to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as we ſuppoſe, that they hurry us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into our own Ruin and Deſtruction. Who
<pb facs="tcp:154149:10"/> can diſcover the Depth of Gods admirable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in making choice of Chriſts Incarnation and Life to redeem Man out of this miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
               <p>God, who is the end at which we ought to aim, and from which we naturally go farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is come himſelf to ſeek us. We had loſt the ſight of him, he hath made himſelf viſible: He thought it not ſufficient to propoſe the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and compleat good to their ſight in his own Perſon, as the only fit object of their Love, but he would ſhew them the way they ſhould go in to come to the full poſſeſſion of it. He became him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their Fellow-Traveller and Guide, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf as a Perſon at a diſtance from God that he might carry us to God with him. He went before us, and reſtored all our Defects by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath reform'd all our Sentiments, and all the affections of our Souls, by the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions, which he ſhewed in the Human Narure which he aſſumed for our Salvation. We were not ſenſible what we ought to Love or Hate, Deſire or Fear, Follow or eſchew; but he hath Inſtructed us by his Example to Order, and regulate the whole courſe of our Lives, with a reference to that ultimate End.

                  <hi>V.</hi> Some directions, how we may read the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, with advantage.</head>
               <p>The Life of Chriſt, being intended, as we have already ſhewed, as the Univerſal Remedy of all the Diſtempers of Mans Soul, deſerves our daily rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſerious Meditation upon it. All Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade Men to it, come far ſhort of this very conſideration. That 'tis the Life, not of a Man, but of a God, ſo that it is in vain to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any other. All that I ſhall add, ſhall be only ſome directions to the Reader, in peruſing it, which may help him to make it as Beneficial, as it is deſign'd, and ought to be to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One of the moſt Important is, that we ſhould always keep it in our minds, whoſe Life it is we are Reading of, that we may not be offended at his Infirmities and Sufferings, by looking upon them as Involuntary. Jeſus Chriſt is God, and by conſequent Almighty; and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could befal him againſt his Will, nor could he ſuffer any thing but what he would, and ſo long as he pleaſed. When we ſee him dying upon the Croſs, let us remember what he hath ſaid, <hi>That he lay'd down his Life of himſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 10.18. Luke 4.30. John 18.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and no Man was able to take it from him.</hi> When he falls into the hands of his Enemies, let us conſider, that before this he had often withdrew himſelf Miraculouſly from the Fury of his Enemies, and before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to be taken, he threw them down on the Earth at his Word alone. If at any time the Evangeliſts, who have undertaken to deſcribe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, what Jeſus did as a Man here upon Earth, do ſometimes repreſent him to us, under ſuch Troubles and Paſſions, as happen to Men invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, let them know that the Evangeliſt, who hath written on purpoſe to prove his Divinity,
<pb facs="tcp:154149:11"/> teaches us, That all theſe Motions were voluntary in him, and that he troubled himſelf.</p>
               <p>But let no Man ſay, That theſe Troubles and Infirmities, though voluntary, were unbecoming God; but, on the contrary, let us honour him the more for them, ſince he made choice of them, who is the Wiſdom and Power of the Father. Let us conſider the Deſign why he underwent our Weakneſſes and Miſeries, and be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed of his Humiliation, that we ſhould admire the wonderful propriety and fitneſs to bring about the End Propoſed, which is the Salvation of Man. The Mockings which the Gentiles treated him withal, were a neceſſary Remedy to cure our Pride; and our Phyſician was willing to take this Medicine himſelf, that he might make it more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and tolerable to the Sick, whom he intended to ſave.</p>
               <p>He ſometimes acted as God, and ſometimes as Man; but managed all his Actions, both Human and Divine for our Benefit. If he manifeſts his Glory by Miracles, it is to make us believe on him, and to perſwade us, that when he ſuffers 'tis not out of Neceſſity, but Love to us: And if he conceal the Glory of his Divinity under the Vail of our Infirmities, 'tis that he may gain our Love and Service as a Guide to us, teaching us by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what we ſhould do and ſuffer. If he oppoſes his Enemies till they are ready to ſtone him, but yet cannot, 'tis that when they ſhall put him to Death, we may be thankful for the Death which he ſuffered to redeem us. He ſubmitted to Death, in Obedience to the Command of his Father, to teach us a patient Submiſſion to all Afflictions God ſhall pleaſe to lay upon us. He was ſeized with Fear and Sorrow at the Approaches of Death, which yet he endured voluntarily, and had long deſired, and which he knew was the Cup given
<pb facs="tcp:154149:12"/> him to drink, by his Father; not that we ſhould think that he drank it unwillingly, but to comfort and inſtruct thoſe that are obliged to dye, either through Force or by Neceſſity of Nature. Thus, like a good Phyſician, he ſubjected himſelf to all our Weakneſſes, that he might make us couragious and ſtrong, to take the wholſome, but bitter Potion which he offered to us. Who could have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the neceſſity of ſuffering and bearing the Croſs, if Jeſus Chriſt had not ſuffered and been crucified for us? Who would think himſelf able to endure Croſſes, when Nature makes ſo ſtrong an Oppoſition, if Jeſus Chriſt had not Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it himſelf? Who, of us, would not tremble at the Efforts which we muſt ſuſtain in encountring the horrible Terrors of Death, had not our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Phyſician ſwet Blood and Water in the ſame Combat? Theſe voluntary Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt are our Conſolation under our involuntary Afflictions; teaching us, that they are no ſins, ſince the Son of God was contented to endure them, and ſhewing us the Way how to engage God's Love to us by them, ſaying to God as his Son did, <hi>Not mine,</hi>

                  <hi>but thy Will be done.</hi> Thus the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our Saviour, though they ſeem unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God, yet are evident Demonſtrations of the Infinite Mercy by which he deſired to ſave us. His Humiliations are all our Honour, ſince he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for us only. Let us adore his Condeſcenſion, and judge with ourſelves that all our Love is due to that God, who abaſed himſelf, ſuffered and dyed for our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Direction, how we ſhould read the Life of our Saviour with Advantage, is to read it with a Deſign of conforming our ſelves to it. All the Holineſs of Men conſiſteth in the Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> for according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, God hath predeſtinated us to be conformed to the
<pb facs="tcp:154149:12"/> Image of his Son.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49.</note> And the ſame Apoſtle teaches us elſwhere, as we have born the Image of the Old Man, by following the irregular Deſires of our Fleſh, we muſt bear the Image of the New Man, which is Chriſt Jeſus, by regulating our Lives by his: Wherefore we ought not to be lead by mere Curioſity to the Reading of this Hiſtory, nor to know his Actions only, but to learn by what he hath done, what we ought to do. He ſaid to the Jews long ſince,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.35.</note> who had heard <hi>John</hi>'s Sermons with Pleaſure; John <hi>was a Burning and Shining Light, and ye were willing, for a Seaſon to rejoyce in his Light:</hi> But it is not ſufficient for us to caſt our Eyes upon him who is the true Light of Men, for he hath diſcovered the Way that leads to eternal Happineſs, not to thoſe who only take ſome Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in knowing his admirable Works, but to thoſe who follow him by a faithful Imitation of his Example. Before we know what Jeſus Chriſt hath done and taught upon Earth; we are like Travellers, who journey in the Night, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they know not whither, becauſe they cannot tell their Way but by reading the Life of Chriſt: We are like the ſame Travellers, who as ſoon as Day breaks perceive their Errors, and return again into the right Way. He came from Heaven to ſhew us the way thither, and to bring us out of the Paths that lead down to Hell. He goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us himſelf, that we may not wander or loſe our Way, nor take any other Way but that in which he leads us. He aſſures us, that all other Ways, but that in which he goes, lead down to Death; wherefore we muſt read his Life to make it a Rule and Exemplar of ours, that all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, being a lively Expreſſion of his, we may ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>It is not I that live,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>but Christ that liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:154149:13"/>
               <p>But it is not ſufficient to read the Life of Chriſt, if we deſire to profit by it, but we muſt meditate upon it, and apply all that we read, becauſe this is the only way to make the right Uſe and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Reading: We need loſe no part of the Hiſtory of the Son of God; for as he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for our Salvation, ſo there is no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Life which we cannot gather ſome Advantage to our ſelves from, if we conſider upon it with ſerious Attention: It will then be worth our while to take every Part of it into Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſee what Benefit we may reap from it, and what Motions and Affections it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in us; for the reading of the Life of Chriſt muſt needs ſometimes inſtruct us, ſometimes ſhame us, ſometimes comfort us, and ſometimes encourage us, and ſometimes inſpire us with Love, Thankfulneſs, Reverence, Joy, Grief, Hope or Fear, according to the different Objects which it preſents to our Obſervation.</p>
               <p>All the Life of Jeſus Chriſt is made up of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Diſcourſes, Actions and Sufferings. He wrought ſo many Miracles to prove his Divinity, and to relieve either the Miſeries or Neceſſities of thoſe who either wanted or deſired his Help: We may make an Advantage of theſe, by ſuppoſing our ſelves to be in the Number of thoſe who ſaw them, and for whoſe ſake they were done. The Eye-Witneſſes of them believed in him, admired and adored him, and became his Diſciples: Let us do the ſame, when we read what they ſaw, adore Chriſt, acknowledge him for our God, believe in his Godhead, and devote our ſelves entirely to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſince we can never honour him as our God but by obeying and loving him.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame manner let us apply all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he did for the Relief of others needs: He healed no bodily Diſeaſes but what were a Figure
<pb facs="tcp:154149:13"/> of the Spiritual Diſtempers of our Souls. Sin is our Leproſy,, our Deafneſs, our Blindneſs, our Palſy, our Death; let us do the ſame to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Health of our Souls, that we read the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Perſons did for their Bodies, to obtain Cure; let us preſent our ſelves before Jeſus, and ſay with the Leper, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean;</hi> and with the blind Man, <hi>Open mine Eyes that I may ſee;</hi> and ſo of others. Let us think that Jeſus requires the ſame Faith for the cure of our Souls that he did of thoſe he healed of their Bodily Diſtempers; and let us look upon that Thankfulneſs, Faith, Love and other Paſſions of thoſe who were miraculouſly cured, as a Pattern of thoſe Affections which we ought to have for the Graces we have received.</p>
               <p>The Diſcourſes of Jeſus Chriſt ought to be read with great Reverence, which conſiſts in believing and practiſing what he teacheth. He is the Truth, and nothing but Truth can ſave us, and we ſhall be judged by that which he hath taught. We muſt hear him, as his Diſciples, and be won by his Words: We muſt diſcover our Ignorance to him, that he may inform us and our Ways, that he may amend them. This muſt be done, in applying every Word of Jeſus Chriſt, and examining our ſelves by it, that we may condemn our ſelves, if we find our ſelves out of the Way which he hath taught, and we may reform our Practice by it. And if there be any thing obſcure in his Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let us make our Prayers to him, to enlighten our Underſtandings in the Knowledge of it, if it be neceſſary to Salvation, practiſing thoſe Truths in the mean Time, that are plain, and worthy of our Obſervation.</p>
               <p>To profit by the Actions of Jeſus Chriſt we muſt look upon them as the Rule and Pattern of our Converſations. He would have us admire
<pb facs="tcp:154149:14"/> his Miracles, but imitate his Actions; for this Reaſon it is that he commands us to learn of him not to cure the Blind or raiſe the Dead,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.30.</note> but to be meek and lowly in Heart: When he commanded the Leper to tell no Man of the Cure he had wrought on him, and fled from the People, who would have made him a King, we ſhould learn to avoid Vain-glory and Ambition from him. We ſhould read the Actions of the Son of God with Deſign of conforming our ſelves to them, when we ſee him waſhing his Apoſtles Feet, putting on the ſame Humility which we ſee in him; and when we ſee him eating with Sinners, learn the ſame Charity. In fine, let us ſtudy the Affections of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and conform our ſelves to them; love nothing but what he loves, and contemn the ſame Things he deſpiſed. He hated Sin, he deſpiſed Riches, Honour and Pleaſures; he loved and ſought the Glory of his Father, and all his Care was to obey and pleaſe him, for which end he refuſed not to undergo Poverty, Affronts, Diſgrace, Grief, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yea, Death itſelf: Theſe are the things he would have us learn from him, and this is what we ſhould think upon and imitate.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Advantage leſs which we may gather from reading the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt. We muſt look upon them, as we have already ſaid, as voluntary; and it is good to conſider them with relation to the Two Ends for which he ſuffered: 1. For our Satisfaction. 2. For our Inſtruction. 1. He ſuffered to ſatisfy Juſtice for our Sins, and endured the Puniſhment of our Offences, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from eternal Torments. The Conſideration of this Action ought to excite in us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Love to Jeſus Chriſt, who endured ſo much to give us a Proof of his Love to us. 2. Hatred and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him, which could not be expected but by the Sufferings and Death of God himſelf, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:154149:14"/> to the Second End for which Chriſt ſuffered, which was our Inſtruction. We ought to make theſe Reflections upon it; in reading them we ought to be ſatisfied, That Sufferings are neceſſary to obtain Heaven, conſidering that this is the Way our Saviour leads us, and went himſelf: When we are perſecuted, we ought to comfort our ſelves with this, that it is an Honour to be treated as our Maſter was. The Submiſſion with which he drank the Cup which his Father gave him to drink, ſhould teach us to welcome the Croſſes which God lays upon us, without murmuring, as Sickneſs, loſs of Goods, Friends, Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Patience in ſuffering Affronts and Abuſes, ſhould quench all our paſſionate Reſentments and Deſires of Revenge, which riſe in our Hearts at the Senſe of Wrongs. In fine, his exemplary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in his Sufferings ſhould teach us to accept the Perſecutions of Men, as ordained by God, and to adore his Juſtice in their moſt unjuſt Dealings with us, to love our Enemies, and be ſo far from requiting the Injuries we receive from them, as to pardon them and do them good, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves in the meek Sufferings of Evil, by the Contemplation of the Glory that ſhall follow; for as S. <hi>Cyprian, Quod est Chriſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. de Idol. van.</note> 
                  <hi>hoc erimus Chriſtiani, ſi Chriſtum fuerimus imitati. If we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſt, we ſhall be like him, and enjoy the ſame Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Direction which I ſhall give thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who would read the Life of Chriſt with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to themſelves, is this; That they would joyn Prayers with their Reading. Before we begin to read, we ſhould beg of God in Prayer, That he would diſcover to us all the imitable Parts and Circumſtances of the Life of his Son; and after we have done Reading, we muſt implore his Grace to do what we have learned from thence to be our
<pb facs="tcp:154149:15"/> Duty;<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us,</hi> ſaith the Goſpel, <hi>being full of Grace and Truth.</hi> He brought Truth to inſtruct us in our Duties, and Grace to enable us to practiſe what he taught us. This Truth which is intended for our Inſtruction is diffuſed through all the Circumſtances of his Life, but we muſt have Eyes able to diſcover it; he muſt give us theſe Eyes, or elſe his Words and Actions will be to us like an encloſed Book, or as ſo many Riddles, which we cannot underſtand: Wherefore, ſince he hath given us abilities to know the Truth, let us pray him to embrace us with Love, and give us that Grace which he hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited for us by his Sufferings, and which may make us receive his Doctrin, and conform to his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 'Tis the Effuſion of this which hath, as I may ſay, perfected the Myſtery of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jeſus Chriſt was made Man to allure the Love of Men; he lived with them to teach them how he would be loved by them; he aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and ſent down the Holy Spirit from thence upon them, to fill their Hearts with that Love that he requires of them. This is the whole Contrivance of our Salvation; let us acknowledge the Obligation which we have to love Jeſus Chriſt, and let us learn, by reading his Life, after what manner he would have us love him, and pray for Grace to love him as we ought, and enkindle in our Hearts that Fire of which he ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend Fire on Earth, and I wiſh it were already kindled.</hi>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE Of, our Saviour, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FOR about Four thouſand Years,<note place="margin">Book I.</note> after the Creation of the World, Man lay groaning under the Power and Tyranny of Satan, to whom he had ſold and enſlaved himſelf by Sin. The greateſt part of the World was involved in Ignorance and Idolatry, and the Jews only had the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, and lived in the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the promiſed Meſſiah: For Man had no ſooner ſubjected himſelf to the Decree of Death, through the ſeducements of the Devil, but God threatned him to raiſe up a Child of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which ſhould maintain a continual War with that Wicked Spirit. And to this end it was that he diſcovered himſelf and his Worſhip to a certain Number of Men, from whoſe Poſterity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154149:20"/> he deſigned to raiſe this Conqueror of the Serpent, and Deliverer of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt to whom God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in his Seed, which he repeated to <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> the Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and after explained more clearly to the Jews, who were the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Twelve Sons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Bleſſing did conſiſt, by giving them Hopes of a Saviour, whoſe Birth, Life and Death he foretold in all their Circumſtances: For he ſo contrived it, that all, that befel them, ſhould be a continued Figure of this Saviour. He appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſuch Sacrifices, as repreſented the great Sacrifice which ſhould expiate and atone for the Sins of Men, and for their ſakes wrought ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as were nothing elſe but Shadows and Signs of what he would do for the Salvation of the whole World.</p>
            <p>So that all things did, as it were, foreſhew this Holy Redeemer. The Prophets, which God ſent them from time to time, put them in Mind of his Coming, and the Calamities which Divine Juſtice inflicted upon them for their Irregularities and Sins, did raiſe their Minds to a more ardent and earneſt Expectation of him, as their Meſſiah or Chriſt. <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Word, and ſignify both of them <hi>Anointed,</hi> the Jews calling him ſo, becauſe they expected, He ſhould be a great King, conſecrated to God by a ſpecial Unction, of which the Anointing of their Kings and Prophets was but a Figure.</p>
            <p>Four thouſand Years being at laſt expired and ſpent in waiting for him, the Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, and foretold by the Prophets, for the Deliverance of Mankind, came. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire enjoyed a profound Peace under the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the Jews were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154149:20"/> by <hi>Herod,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had made King over them, being ſome Years before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubject to their Power. This Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Foreign Prince was an Evident Sign that the Coming of the Meſſiah drew near, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Propheſy of <hi>Jacob:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> 
               <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his Feet, until</hi> [Shiloh] he that is ſent, <hi>do come.</hi> This was the Time, which God from all Eternity had prefixed for the Execution of his gracious Deſign, That Jeſus Chriſt, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our both of the Jews and Gentiles, ſhould be born in <hi>Judea;</hi> and by him hath he accompliſh'd the great Work of Man's Salvation in ſuch a manner as the Goſpel relates, and which we are about to give an account of in this Hiſtory, of which I ſhall make Four Parts, containing ſo many Periods of our Saviour's Life, and ſhew what paſſed.

It was an Holy Virgin of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> named <hi>Mary,</hi> who was eſpouſed to a Man of the ſame Family, called <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and living in perfect Chaſtity, had her Spouſe for a faithful Witneſs and Guardian of her Purity. The Angel being come to her, ſaid, <hi>Hail, O thou, that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee; bleſſed art thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154149:23"/> among Women.</hi> Her Modeſty raiſed in her a great Diſturbance, at the unuſual Appearance of the Angel, and ſhe was ſurprized at this kind of Salutation. But the Angel bid her not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, telling her, That ſhe ſhould have a Son, who ſhould be great, and be called the Son of the Moſt High, to whom God would give the Throne of his Father <hi>David, i. e.</hi> an Eternal Kingdom, and that ſhe ſhould call his Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which ſignifies a Saviour. She reflecting upon her way of living with Holy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and not underſtanding how ſhe could preſerve her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, and yet become a Mother, ſaid unto the Angel, <hi>How ſhall this be, ſeeing I know not a Man?</hi> The Angel anſwered her, That this Holy Child, which ſhall be called the Son of God, ſhall be born by the inviſible Operation of the Holy Ghoſt; and to ſhew her, that God, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible, would work this great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in her by his Almighty Power, he tells her, what had befallen her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who having been barren for many Years, was Six Months ſince with Child. Being ſatisfied by this Inſtance, that ſhe might bear a Child, and yet continue a Virgin, ſhe humbly ſubmitted her ſelf to the appointment of God, and ſaid to the Angel, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word.</hi> Then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel departed from her, but the Holy Spirit wrought this great Myſtery in her, for which ſhe had been fitted and diſpoſed a great while before, by the plentiful effuſion of his Graces. She conceived the Son of God, the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Holy Trinity, who was incarnate, <hi>i. e.</hi> became Man, by taking on him a Body and Soul, like us, in the Womb of this chaſt and humble Virgin.</p>

How great a Felicity is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come unto me?</hi> And having inform'd the Virgin, That her Child leaped in her Womb, ſhe added; <hi>Bleſſed art thou becauſe thou haſt believed; for the Things, which have been told thee from the Lord, ſhall be accompliſhed.</hi> Theſe Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did not at all puff up the Virgin's Heart with Pride; ſhe could not be unſenſible of the Favours which God had beſtowed on her; but being deſirous to give him all the Glory, and not daring to attribute any thing that the Lord had wrought in her, to her Faith, ſhe referr'd all to the Mercy of her Creator, ſaying, <hi>My Soul doth magnify the Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour; for he hath regarded the lowlineſs of his Handmaid.</hi> She adds, That God is pleaſed, when he ſees fit, to do great Things for his mean Creatures; That he loves to exalt the Humble and debaſe the Proud; and that, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He is faithful to his Promiſes, becauſe he made her the Mother of his Son, <hi>That he might perform the Promiſes which he had made to</hi> Abraham, and the other Patriarchs.</p>

                     <hi>Mary</hi> continued Three Months with her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and then returned to her own Houſe. In the mean while, <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time of Delivery came, and her Relations and Couſins met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to rejoyce with her concerning the Birth of her Son. On the Eighth Day, when he was to be circumciſed and named, they all gave him the Name of <hi>Zachary,</hi> as his Father was called; but <hi>Elizabeth</hi> oppoſed them, deſiring he ſhould be named <hi>John,</hi> as God had commanded by the Angel. They anſwered her, That there was none of her Family called by that Name, and made Signs to his Father, that he ſhould ſhew them his Will about it: And he required Writing-Tables, and wrote thereon, <hi>His Name muſt be called</hi> John; and immediately his Tongue was looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Speech being reſtored to him, he made uſe of it to praiſe God: But all that had been Witneſſes of theſe Miracles, and all that heard him ſpeak were aſtoniſhed, and ſaid one to another, What manner of Child ſhall this be? How great, how holy a Man?</p>
                  <p>But that, which they were ignorant of, was revealed to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> who being filled with the Holy Spirit, underſtood the Myſtery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and the part his Son was to have in that Myſtery; whereupon he propheſied, and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his People.</hi> He adds as the Virgin had done in her Song, That God hath raiſed out of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> a Saviour of the World, to perform the Promiſes which he had made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and renewed often by the Mouth of his Prophets: And then he ſums up all the Benefits of the Incarnation in a few Words;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154149:24"/> he hath promiſed us, <hi>That we, being delivered from the Power of our Enemies, might ſerve him, by walking before him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the Days of our Life.</hi> Then he ſpeaks theſe Words to his Son. <hi>And thou, Child, ſhalt be called the Prophet of the moſt high; for thou ſhalt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Face of the Lord, to prepare his Ways, and to give Knowledge of Salvation, to his People, for the Remiſſion of their Sins.</hi> And indeed God did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil what <hi>Zachary</hi> had foretold of his Son; and that he might fit this Infant for the great Office he deſigned him, he made him eminent in all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts, and kept him in the Deſerts, till the Time of his appearing to his People <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>The Time being come when the Virgin ſhould be delivered, ſhe brought forth Jeſus Chriſt, in the manner which we ſhall hereafter ſpeak of: But before we relate the Hiſtory of this Birth, it is neceſſary to give an account of the Perſon, who was born. Men deſcribe the Genealogies of the Grandees of the World, that they may make them honourable by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Parentage and great Actions of their Anceſtors, who have no Worth of their own to render them remarkable.<note place="margin">Matth. 1.1-17. Luke 3. 23-38.</note> 
                     <hi>Mary</hi> brought forth a Son, of whom the Goſpel recites Two Pedigrees and Two Births, becauſe he had Two Natures: Jeſus Chriſt is both God and Man, and hath unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Perſon the Divine and Human Nature. As he is Man, he is deſcended of a numerous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Anceſtors: As he is God, he hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God for his Father; as Man, he was born in Time, but as God he was born and is from all Eternity. What S. <hi>John,</hi> in the beginning of his Goſpel teaches us concerning his Divine and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation, and for what Reaſons he became Incarnate, is this.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, That Jeſus Chriſt, as God, <hi>is the Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1.1-14.</note> i. e. the Thought or Speech of God: When a Man thinks, he forms an Idea or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Image of the Thing he thinks of, and this Image is called the <hi>Word,</hi> i. e. the Speech of the Mind; for it is by the Thoughts that the Mind reaſons with, and ſpeaks to it ſelf. God is a pure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154149:25"/> Spirit, who knows himſelf moſt perfectly, and that from all Eternity. He thinks then, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, and forms an exact Image of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and this Image is his Word. But this Word infinitely excels all the Thoughts of Men in this, That he is a Thought ſubſiſting by himſelf, and a diſtinct Perſon from him, that formed it, but yet the ſame God with him. The Two Perſons love each other infinitely, from all Eternity; and this Eternal Love is a Third Perſon, called the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, who is alſo the ſame God, and of the ſame Nature with the Two other Perſons, from whom he proceeds. This is what the Holy Scripture teaches us of the Holy Trinity, which is nothing elſe but the God which we worſhip, One in Three Perſons, of which the Second is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only the Son, becauſe he is begotten of the Father, to whom the Name of Father is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for that Reaſon, but alſo the Word, becauſe he is the Thought, or interior Speech of the Firſt Perſon, which begat him by knowing himſelf, and that from all Eternity, becauſe he knoweth himſelf from all Eternity. And upon this Ground it is that S. <hi>John</hi> ſays, That <hi>in the Beginning, i. e.</hi> when the World began, <hi>the Word was, and the Word was,</hi> in, <hi>or</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> for the Thought is in the Mind that forms it; and that he <hi>was God,</hi> it being the Property of this Word, as we have ſaid, to be the ſame thing with the Being, that begets it.</p>

                     <hi>XIII.</hi> The Preaching of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist.</head>
                  <p>While <hi>John</hi> was in the Deſert God enriched him with the Gifts of his Spirit,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.1.</note> and in that Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fitted him for the great Employment he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, as Jeſus himſelf was ſecretly fitted for the Offices of his Miniſtry in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Houſe: They both waited with Patience for the Time which God hath appointed for the Exerciſe and Execution of them. And becauſe Jeſus Chriſt was not to appear till <hi>John</hi> had preached him, therefore God brought him firſt out of his Retreat. This Holy Fore-runner of Chriſt therefore in the Fifteenth Year of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> by the Divine Order, did go into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154149:31"/> into all the Country round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baptiſm of Repentance, not that which procures Remiſſion of Sins,<note place="margin">Mar. 1.4.</note> but which diſpoſes Men to receive Pardon, and was a Figure of the Baptiſm which Jeſus Chriſt afterward appointed. This Office and Miniſtry of S. <hi>John</hi> was foretold by Two Prophets, which are cited by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> the one calls him <hi>the Meſſenger</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> of God, which ſhould go before Jeſus Chriſt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Ways before him: The other ſaying,<note place="margin">Iſai. 40.3.</note> That they ſhall hear the Voice of him that cryeth in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Prepare ye the Way of the Lord;</hi> and then, <hi>every Valley ſhall be filled, and every Mountain and Hill ſhall be made low; the crooked Paths ſhall be made ſtreight, and the rough Places plain:</hi> Which figurative Expreſſions import no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that a thorough Reformation of Mens Manners ſhall then begin, and be compleated by the Preaching of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>He began his Preaching with theſe Words,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.1-6.</note> 
                     <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand;</hi> and to gain the greater Authority, to his Sermons, he preached Repentance, as well by his Example as Words, for he was cloathed with Camel's Hair, and wore a Leathern Girdle about his Loyns, and lived upon Locuſts and wild Honey; a courſe Garb and Food ſuitable for a Penitent: And certainly ſuch a Preacher, as firſt practiſes what himſelf teaches, muſt needs be extraordinarily followed. And ſo indeed he was, for all <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Country round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> and all <hi>Judea</hi> flocked to him, and confeſſing their Sins, were baptized of him in <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the great Multitude that followed him, there came alſo certain of the Phariſees,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.7-10.</note> and of the Sadduces, to be baptized of him.

Art thou greater than our Father</hi> Jacob <hi>who gave us this Well, and drank of it himſelf, and all his Family?</hi> Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>He that drinks of this Water ſhall thirſt again, but he that ſhall drink of the Water that I will give him, ſhall never thirſt, but it ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Well in him ſpringing up unto eternal Life,</hi> which he meant, either of that Grace, which

Jeſus ſaid to her, Go, call thy Husband: She anſwered that ſhe had no Husband; whereupon Jeſus reply'd, Thou hast good cauſe to ſay ſo, for thou haſt had five Husbands, and he that thou now haſt is not thy Husband: in this thou haſt ſaid truly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe words ſhe perceived that he knew how ſhe had lived; and ſhe ſaid unto him,<note place="margin">Jo. 4.19.-26.</note> either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his diſcourſe to a more pleaſing Subject, or that ſhe might get ſome Advantage, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from a Perſon ſo knowing, <hi>Lord I am ſenſible that thou art a Prophet,</hi> I pray reſolve me this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: <hi>Our Fathers worſhipped upon this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ye ſay that</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>is the place where Men ought to Worſhip,</hi> VVhich of us are in the Right? Jeſus takes an occaſion to tell this VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that God being a Spirit, and the Truth, he will be adored in Spirit and Truth, and be known by thoſe that worſhip him; that this VVorſhip depends not upon Places, and the time is coming when he ſhall be worſhipped in that manner only. She replyed, I know that Meſſias will come, and when he is come, he will Inſtruct us throughly in theſe matters. Whereupon Jeſus ſaid unto her, <hi>I am the very Meſſias that thou ſpeakeſt of.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time his Diſciples, who were gone into the City to buy Food,<note place="margin">Jo. 4.27.-34.</note> came and wondred to ſee him Diſcourſe ſo freely with the VVoman, but the reſpect, which they had for him, hindred them from demanding the Reaſon of it.

And when his Diſciples earneſtly deſired him to eat; <hi>he ſaid unto them, I have meat to eat, which ye know not of;</hi> and then he explains to them, what ſort of meat he meant, in theſe Words, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his Work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeak but of one of them, whoſe Poſſeſſion they deſcribe more exactly, either becauſe he was moſt tormented by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, or becauſe he was the moſt remarkable of the Two, or becauſe his Cure was moſt admired and talked of, for he had been poſſeſſed a long time, and had neither Cloaths nor Habitation, but abode Day and Night in the Mountains, and in the Tombs, crying and cutting himſelf with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154149:42"/> Stones: And though he had often been loaded with Chains, and had his Feet fettered, yet he had always broken the Fetters and Chains: And the Devils then carried him into the Wilderneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that no Man could ever tame him. This Man ſaw Jeſus Chriſt a far off, and he, with his Companion, ran to him, and the Devil that ſpake by his Mouth, prayed the Son of God, not to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, by commanding him, as he had done, to go out of the Man poſſeſſed. Nevertheleſs Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus commanded him to go out of the Man; and at the ſame Time asked him his Name. he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That he was called <hi>Legion, becauſe many Devils had entred</hi> into that miſerable Man: And, ſince it is one of their greateſt Torments to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from doing Miſchief to Men, they earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly implored Jeſus Chriſt not to command them to go into the Deep, but to permit them, if he caſt them out of theſe Two Poſſeſſed, to enter into an Herd of Swine, which was feeding, not far from that Place, upon the Mountains; the Son of God granted them what they deſired, and by delivering theſe Hogs into their Power, he teacheth us, 1. That he may diſpoſe of all we have, as he pleaſeth, becauſe we have nothing but what we receive from him. 2. That the Devil hath no Power, neither over us nor our Goods, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God permitteth him. 3. That ſuch is the Hatred and Rage of the Devil againſt Men, that he would torment them for ever, either in their Perſons or Eſtates, and would do all he could to ſatiate his Fury, did not God ſet Bounds to it, as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>This appears evidently to us from what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe Swine; for as ſoon as Jeſus permitted them to enter into them, they made them all run violently upon the Rocks, and from thence caſt themſelves head-long into the Lake, where about
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154149:43"/> 2000 of them were drowned. The Keepers of the Swine went immediately into the Cities and Towns round about, to carry the News of this Accident, and they brought a great Number of People to the place where Jeſus was, to be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the Truth of their Relation. Here they found the Man, out of whom Jeſus had caſt the Legion of Devils, ſitting at Jeſus's Feet, cloathed, and in his right Mind, and as quiet and calm as he had been furious and mad before. And thoſe, who had been Eye-witneſſes of it, told them all the Circumſtances of his Cure, and they were greatly afraid.</p>
                  <p>Then came all the City of <hi>Gadara</hi> to Jeſus, and could not look upon him, but with much Horror: They had a great Veneration for him, who had ſo abſolute an Authority over the Devils, but were afraid of the Man, who had driven their Swine into the Sea; and therefore, either becauſe they did not think themſelves worthy of Jeſus's Preſence, or becauſe they were afraid of greater Loſſes than they had already ſuſtained, they beſought him to depart out of their Country. The Man, who had been poſſeſſed, beſought him, who had been his Deliverer, to ſuffer him to go along with him; but Jeſus anſwered him, <hi>Return to thine own Houſe, and declare what great Things God hath done for thee.</hi> He obeyed his Order, and went through every City, and through all that Country, thankfully publiſhing and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the great Favours that Jeſus had done unto him.</p>

At the ſame time it happen'd, That a Woman, who had been ſick of a Bloody Flux, for Twelve Years, and had ſpent all her Eſtate to get a Cure of it, and had endured much by Phyſicians, and could get no help, having heard the Fame of Jeſus, came behind him, among the Multitude, and touched him by the Border of his Garment, for ſhe had ſo great a Faith, that ſhe was throughly perſwaded in her ſelf, <hi>If I can but touch his Garment, I ſhall be whole:</hi> And indeed ſo ſhe was, for as ſoon as ſhe had done it, ſhe felt, the ſame inſtant, that ſhe was cured of her Diſeaſe. But Jeſus, who knew, as the Goſpel ſays, That <hi>Vertue was gone out of him</hi> turned himſelf about in the Throng, and asked, <hi>Who it was that had touched him: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the other Diſciples, anſwered him, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the People throng,</hi> and preſs thee, <hi>and dost thou ask, who it is that touched me?</hi> But Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Some Body hath touched me, for I perceive that vertue is gone out of me;</hi> and he looked all-round about him, to ſee her who had touched him with ſo much Faith, that by it ſhe had received the Cure of her Diſtemper. The Woman ſeeing her ſelf diſcovered, caſt her ſelf down at the Feet of Jeſus with Fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and acknowledged, before the Multitude, what had happened unto her. The Son of God comforted her, and ſaid unto her; <hi>Daughter, be not afraid, thy Faith hath ſaved thee, go in Peace,</hi> and be perfectly whole of thy Diſeaſe.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154149:45"/>

Jeſus entring in, ſaid unto them, <hi>Why make ye ſo much a do,</hi> howling and lamenting, <hi>the Maid is not dead but ſleepeth.</hi> At theſe Words of his, they laughed and mocked, knowing well that ſhe was dead; but being ignorant, that it was as eaſy for Jeſus to raiſe the Dead, as it is for Men to awake thoſe that are aſleep, He then put forth the People out of the Chamber, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only three of his Diſciples, <hi>viz. Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with the Father and Mother of the Child to go in with him: Then he goeth to the Bed where ſhe lay, taketh her by the Hand, and called to her, ſaying, <hi>Damoſel, ariſe.</hi> By theſe powerful Words he reſtored her Life, and ſhe roſe; And when they had given her ſomething to eat, ſhe walked, to the Wonder of her Father and Mother. At his departure he commanded them very ſtrictly to <hi>tell no Man what was done;</hi> but the Fame of this Miracle ſpread it ſelf in all that Country.</p>

That he came not to deſtroy the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> but to fulfil it, and to bring it to its utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by teaching his Diſciples a Righteouſneſs far more compleat and excellent, than that of the Scribes and Phariſees, and without which no Man can be ſaved. Indeed the Old Law forbids ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sins, and regulated the exterior Actions. But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154149:49"/> the New Law, which Jeſus Chriſt gives in this Diſcourſe, aims at the Reformation of the Heart, and to ſuppreſs Sin in its very Source and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. For it was ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt commands every Man to curb in his Anger, and not to utter the leaſt affront or abuſe of his Brother; and if there be any differences, not to offer any Sacrifice to God, before they are reconciled. The Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Adultery, Jeſus forbids with the ſame ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all Laſcivious Glances, and commands Men to pluck out the right Eye in which they are, <hi>i. e.</hi> to deprive themſelves of that pleaſure of the Sight, which excites irregular deſires in the Heart. The Law commands us to avoid Perjury; Jeſus Chriſt will not allow us to Swear at all, and Teaches us, that when we are obliged to confirm our Words with an Oath, that very Oath, tho' not ſinful in it ſelf, yet proceeds from a bad Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, from the Cuſtom of Lying, and dealing falſly ſo much uſed among Men, that they dare not truſt to their bare Words. The Law regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Revenge, and requires, that the puniſhment do not exceed the Offence, on which it is inflicted; But Jeſus Chriſt is ſo far from allowing us to revenge our ſelves, that on the contrary he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not to reſiſt evil, not to go to Law, but to give to thoſe that ask, and to yield our Cheek to thoſe that ſmite us, <hi>i. e.</hi> to bear all things rather than loſe Charity. The <hi>Jews</hi> believed that the Obligation we have to Love our Neighbour, did hinder us from hating our Enemies: But Jeſus Chriſt will have us to love thoſe that Hate us, and to do good to thoſe that Perſecute us, that we may excell the Heathens in well-doing, and imitate Himſelf, who makes his Sun to riſe upon the Evil as well as upon the Good, and ſo deſerve the Honourable Title of the Children of God.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:154149:50"/>
                  <p>From Sins he paſſes to Good actions, and to make them pure,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.1-34.</note> he teacheth us to purify the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and cauſes of them, ſhewing us that the Intention is ſuch to the outward Actions, as the Eye is to the whole Body, and that they are pure or ſinful, according as the Intention is good or Evil, after the ſame manner, as the Body is either Light, or in Darkneſs, as the Eye is either Clear or Blind. Wherefore he teaches us, that we muſt not perform our good Works, as Alms, Prayers, or Faſting, that we may be praiſed of Men; but of God, who will reward them. He lays down rules for Prayer, that it ſhould be made with a full Truſt in the Divine Bounty, with perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and with a mind full of Peace and Love to our Brethren, knowing that he that will neither give to, nor pardon others, deſerves neither the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor Pardon he petitions of God. He makes the force and excellency of a Prayer, not to conſiſt in a multitude of Words, as if God had need of our Words to manifeſt our Wants to him; and that we may know, what we may deſire, and requeſt of God, he hath taught us to pray after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, in Earth as it is in Heaven, Give us this day our daily Bread, and forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us, and Lead us not into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> Amen. In the next place he endeavours to make the Souls of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples contemn the good things of this World, by teaching them not to lay up Treaſures upon Earth, but in Heaven, where neither Thief, nor any other danger is to be feared; that they cannot love God and Mamon, <hi>i. e.</hi> Riches, at the ſame time, and that inſtead of being ſollicitous for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of this Life, ſince God, who nouriſheth the Fowls, and adorns the Lillies, will not ceaſe to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154149:50"/> take care of Man, who is far more precious in his ſight, than Flowers or Beaſts: We ſhould firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof above all other things, and then we may hope, that God will give us all other things, as an Overplus of favour to us.</p>
                  <p>He forbids raſh Cenſures and Judgments,<note place="margin">Matt. 7.1-29.

But Jeſus, who knew his thoughts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him the example of two Men, who owed to one Creditor, the one a great Sum of Mony, and the other a far leſſer Sum, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The Son of God approving this Anſwer, made the Application of it in theſe Words, <hi>Seeſt thou this Woman? I entred into thy Houſe, thou haſt poured no Water upon my Feet, but ſhe hath waſhed them with Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head. Thou gavest me no Kiſs, but this Woman, ſince the Time ſhe came in, hath not ceaſed to kiſs my Feet. Thou hast poured no Oyl upon my Head, but ſhe hath anointed my Feet with Perfumes: For this Reaſon, I ſay unto thee, her many and great Sins are forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much; but to whom little is forgiven the ſame will love little:</hi> As if he had ſaid unto him, Thou loveſt little, becauſe believing thy ſelf to be juſt, thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to owe God but little. This Woman, who is Conſcious of her own great Crimes, hath loved him greatly, from whom ſhe hopes for Pardon of ſo many Sins, and for that love's Sake is forgiven: Wherefore he ſaith to the Woman, <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> The Gueſts, that ſat at Table with him, were offended at theſe Words, ſaying in themſelves, Who is this that pretends to forgive Sins? But Jeſus contemning their Diſcontents, ſent the Woman away, whom he had pardoned, ſaying to her, <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaved thee, Go in Peace.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, He threatens them with ſuch Fury as the Devil exerciſes over thoſe Perſons from whom they have been once forced to go out, but have found out a way to enter again; which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more enraged.

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.1-23. Luke 8.4 15. Mark 4.1-20.</note>The ſame Day Jeſus went out of the Houſe, and came to the end of the Lake of <hi>Genneſareth;</hi> but when he ſaw a great Multitude of People coming unto him, from the neighbouring Towns, he went into a Ship, and inſtructed the People out of it, who gave great Attention to him from the Shore. He delivered many excellent and ſaving Truths to them in Parables, which was his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of Teaching. <hi>Parables</hi> in the Goſpel, are feigned Stories or Compariſons, taken from Nature Things, the Application of which being ſomething hard to find out, exerciſes the Attention of the Mind, but, being diſcovered, opens ſome Myſtery of Religion to us, or makes known ſome important Maxim or Precept for the Government and Direction of our Manners. As for Example, this is a kind of Parable, which Jeſus ſpeaks of the ſtrong Man, armed, who keeps his Houſe, but is expelled by a ſtronger than he. The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which is this, as we have ſeen; The ſtrong Man is the Devil, whom Jeſus Chriſt drives out of Men's Souls by the Spirit of God, which is ſtronger than the Devil.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:154149:56"/>
                  <p>The Firſt Parable which the Son of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the People, from the Ship where he ſat, was this. A Man went out to ſow, and ſome of his Seed fell in the High-Way, and it was trodden upon and devoured with Birds: Another Part fell upon a Rock, and was ſcorched by the Sun, becauſe it had no Root, for want of Moiſture: Other fell among Thorns, which chok'd it: And other fell on good Ground, and brought forth Fruit in abundance.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the Application of this Parable, which our Saviour intended by it, was not eaſy to find out, he added, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear, i. e.</hi> let him underſtand the Senſe and Meaning of what I ſay. The Apoſtles themſelves did underſtand it no more than others, and therefore when they were alone with him, they prayed him to tell them, why he ſpoke to the People in Parables, and to explain what he had already propounded to them. In anſwer to the Firſt Queſtion, he tells them, How great an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they enjoyed, in being with him, becauſe they ſaw and heard thoſe Things which many Righteous Men and Prophets deſired to ſee and hear, but could not obtain it. And becauſe he made them underſtand clearly thoſe great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which he propounded to others in dark Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes and Parables only, to puniſh the Blindneſs and Obſtinacy of their Hearts; which makes them unworthy and incapable of knowing the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Then he teaches them, That by the Seed, he ſpoke of, he underſtood the Word of God: They, that after they have heard, regard it not but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately let themſelves looſe to their Sins, are like the High-Way. The Devil is figured by the Birds, who are ready to take the Word out of their Hearts, leſt they believe and be ſaved. Thoſe that receive the Word with Joy, but the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154149:57"/> ſpoils all the Fruit, becauſe the Word has had no deep Root in the Soul, are the Rock. Others, that choke the Word with Avarice, love of Pleaſures and other Paſſions, are the Thorns, which muſt be pulled up, if we will have the heavenly Seed to thrive in our Hearts. Laſtly, the good Ground ſignifies thoſe well-diſpoſed Souls, which receive and retain faithfully the Word of God, and, through Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy bring forth as much Fruit as they are able.</p>

                     <hi>XXVI.</hi> Other Parables.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.24.-35. Mark 4.26-34. Luke 13.18-30.</note>He propounded alſo ſeveral other Parables. He compares the World to a Field, in which the Owner ſowed good Seed, but afterward diſcerned it to be mixed with Darnel, which his Enemy had ſown in the Night; his Servants, as ſoon as they ſaw it, would have weeded it up, but he hindred them, leſt they ſhould root up the Corn with it, and bad them let it grow with the Corn till the Harveſt, when he would have it ſeparated from the Corn and burnt, but gather the Corn into his Barn. He compares the Kingdom of God to Seed, which, being caſt into the Ground, ſprings up, and grows, the Sower knows not how, without any further Care: Then to Muſtard-Seed, which being a very ſmall Seed, leſs than any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the biggeſt among Herbs. Laſtly, to Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is put into the Dough till the whole is Leaven'd.</p>
                  <p>When he had ſpoken theſe things, he ſent the People away, and returned to the Houſe with his Diſciples, who prayed him to declare to them the Meaning of the Parable of the Darnel. He tells them, That it ſignifies, That the Good ought to tolerate the Wicked, with whom they are mixed,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154149:57"/> till God ſhall ſeparate them, the one from the other, at the End of the World; for then the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall be caſt into Hell-Fire, and the Good ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>He teaches them alſo the ſame Truth, under the Parable of the Fiſhermen, who catch all ſorts of Fiſh in their Nets, promiſcuouſly, but ſitting upon the Bank, ſeparate the Good, which they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away, and caſt away the Bad. Laſtly, he makes them ſenſible that we ought to part with any thing to purchaſe Heaven, by the Compariſon of a Man, who ſold all he had to buy a Pearl of great Price, or the Field, in which he knew there was a great Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel gives us the Explication of none of the other Parables, that by an Attentive Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe which are explained, we may find out the Senſe of thoſe that are not, our ſelves, having firſt begged of God that Spirit of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which Jeſus Chriſt requires of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when he ſays, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</hi> The Ignorant and Simple, who have not Abilities to find out the Signification of thoſe Parables which the Son of God hath not unfolded, and who may juſtly fear miſtaking by following their own Senſe, ought to conſult their Paſtors about ſuch difficult Places, and while we wait for the Reſolution of what we demand, practiſing the Truths they know, which it is eaſy for an humble and teachable Soul to underſtand. And for the help of theſe ſort of Perſons it is that I compoſed this Work chiefly, and therefore ſhall give you the Senſe of the Three following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to that of the Darnel, out of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church.</p>
                  <p>All Three of them may ſignify the Preaching of the Goſpel; The Preacher diſperſes the Seed of the Word, and this Seed groweth by little and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154149:58"/> little, by the ſecret Operation of God's Grace in the Heart of him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.6.</note> that receives it; for the Preacher Soweth, Planteth and Watereth. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contemned, at firſt, than the Doctrin of the Goſpel; but, like a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, it hath grown and filled the whole Earth. Laſtly, we muſt carefully keep and preſerve the Word of the Goſpel in our Hearts, that the Sacred Leaven may leaven the whole Lump, and by its ſecret Vertue reform all the Thoughts, Deſires and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Man.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.54-58. Mark. 6.1-6. Luke 4.16-30.</note>The Son of God, after he had finiſhed theſe Parables, went to Preach in the City of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> where he had been conceived and brought up: His Diſciples were alſo with him. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his uſual Cuſtom, he went into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue on the Sabboth Day, where ſtanding up to read, they gave him the Book of the Prophet <hi>Iſaias;</hi> He opened it, and found the Place, where the Prophet, ſpeaking of the Meſſias,<note place="margin">Iſai. 61.1.</note> ſays, That he was conſecrated, and ſent by the Spirit of God, to preach the Goſpel to the Poor, to heal the Sick, to publiſh the Day of Grace from the Lord, and declare the Day of Judgment. When he had read this Text, he ſhut the Book, and gave it to the Miniſter. Then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down he explained this Prophecy, and ſhews, that it was accompliſhed in himſelf. All that were in the Synagogue fixed their Eyes on him, while he ſpake, and wondred ſo much at the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth, that they demanded one of another, <hi>Whence hath this Man this great Wiſdom</hi> (which he ſhews?) <hi>Is not this the Son of the Carpenter, called</hi> Joſeph, <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary? <hi>and are not his Brethren,</hi> i. e.

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:154149:58"/> Joſes, <hi>and</hi> Simon <hi>and</hi> Judas? <hi>and are not his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with us? Whence then hath this Man all theſe thing?</hi> The Goſpel obſerves, That he was not only a Subject of Aſtoniſhment, but alſo of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal: Whereupon Jeſus, knowing their Thoughts, ſaith unto them, Ye will ſurely apply this Proverb to me, <hi>Phyſitian, Heal thy ſelf,</hi> as a Reproach to him, that he would not do as great Miracles in his own Country, as he had done at <hi>Capernaum:</hi> But he aſſures them, That a Prophet that is well received and honoured everywhere elſe, is neither received nor honoured in his own Country: This he proves by Two Examples, the firſt of <hi>Elias,</hi> who, in a Famine, was not ſent by God to the Widows of his own Country, but to a Widow of another Country, to receive Relief in his need. And the other of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who cured a ſtrange Lord of a Leproſy, when there were many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who would not deſire a Cure from him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Truths much incenſed all thoſe that were in the Synagogue; and they aroſe in their Fury, and led him out of the City to the Top of a Mountain, to caſt him down from it: But becauſe he could only dye at the Time and in the manner he himſelf pleaſed, he withdrew himſelf from the Fury of theſe wretched Men, and paſſing through the midſt of them, he retreated from <hi>Nazareth.</hi> The Goſpel obſerves. That he did but very few Miracles, and healed a very ſmall Number of Sick People then, only by laying Hands on them; the Infidelity of his hardned City, rendring it unworthy of his Preſence and good Deeds.</p>

                     <hi>XXVIII.</hi> Jeſus goeth about <hi>Galilee</hi> again, and ſends his Apoſtles to preach.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 9.35-38. Luke 8.1-3.</note>Jeſus, being departed from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> went again throughout all <hi>Galilee,</hi> going into every City and every Village, teaching in their Synagogues, preaching the Goſpel, and healing every Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and every Diſeaſe. And the Twelve Apoſtles were with him, to whom alſo were joyned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Women, who had been freed from Evil Spirits, and cured of their Diſtempers: Among whom were <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom went Seven Devils, and <hi>Joanna,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Chuza, Herod</hi>'s Steward, and <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and ſeveral others, who miniſtred to him of their Subſtance. In this Journey he looked upon this great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to whom he was about to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as ſo many fainting and ſcattered Sheep, which have no Shepherd to look after them; and being moved with Compaſſion, he ſaid to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; <hi>The Harvest indeed is great, but the Labourers are few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harvest, that he would ſend Labourers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since he himſelf was Lord of this Harveſt, and his Apoſtles were the Labourers,<note place="margin">Matth 10.1-42. Mark 6.7-13. Luke 9.1-9.</note> whom he had deſigned for that Work long before; He called them, gave them Power to cure Diſeaſes and caſt out Devils, and ſent them, Two and Two, to preach the Kingdom of God, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt given them ſuch Rules as he would have them obſerve in the Exerciſe of their Miniſtry. He ordered them to preach to the Jews only, and make this the Subject of all their Sermons, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> To uſe that Power
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154149:59"/> freely that has been given freely; not to incumber themſelves with Mony, or variety of Cloaths, that they may be the more free to diſcharge their Office, becauſe they muſt receive a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Maintenance from thoſe to whom they Preach: To chuſe their Abode, in all Places, with Honeſt, Good Men: To ſay, when they go into their Houſes, <hi>Peace be to this Houſe;</hi> to ſtay there, ſo long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Place: And to ſhake off the Duſt off their Feet, againſt thoſe who will neither receive nor hear them.</p>
                  <p>He then tells them, That he ſends them as Sheep among Wolves, and that they ought to live among thoſe Sinners, whom they labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, with Simplicity and Caution: That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their Warineſs, they ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; that the only way to eſcape is to fly, and, if they are taken and carried before Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, they ſhould not trouble themſelves, how to anſwer their Judges, becauſe the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall ſupply them with an Anſwer: That they ſhould only take Care not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with Fear; and that they ſhould not fear Men, who have Power over the Body only, but fear God, who can deſtroy both the Body and Soul eternally: That if they diſown him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, he will diſown them before God, at they Day of Judgment; but, on the contrary, he will acknowledge them for his, who are not aſhamed to confeſs his Name. Laſtly, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in ſuffering the greateſt Torments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be wanting of their Duty, he aſſures them, That nothing ſhould befal them but by the Order of God, who counteth all the Hairs of their Heads, and by loſing their Lives for him in this World, they ſhould ſave it to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154149:60"/> That they could not be his Diſciples, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they took up their Croſs and follow him; and that they ought not to expect better Uſage than their Maſter, whom they had ſeen themſelves to be called a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that had a Devil, even by thoſe Men whom he came to ſave.</p>
                  <p>He concludes this Diſcourſe with Rewards that they ſhall have, who hear their Word, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with Things neceſſary; ſaying, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall give you but a Cup of cold Water, to drink, in my Name, verily, I ſay unto you, he ſhall have his Reward. The Apoſtles having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe Inſtructions, went throughout all the Country, preaching to the People, That they ſhould repent; and God confirmed their Diſcourſes with Miracles, for they caſt out many Devils, and by Anointing many, that were Sick, with Oil, cured them.</p>

                  <p>Jeſus having thus withdrawn himſelf,<note place="margin">Jo. 6.22,-71.</note> all the People, whom he had ſo Miraculouſly Fed with Five Loaves, were much troubled to know what was become of him: They had ſeen the Apoſtles go into the Ship to paſs over the Water, but Jeſus did not embark with them, and there was no other Ship there. The next day, as ſoon as they knew that he was not on that ſide, they took Ship, and went to <hi>Capernaum</hi> to ſeek him. And when they had found him, they ſaid unto him, <hi>Maſter, when cameſt thou hither?</hi> for they could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how he got over the VVater. He anſwered them, <hi>Ye ſeek me,</hi> becauſe ye were fed with the Loaves. Labour for another ſort of nouriſhment, that periſheth not, but continueth to eternal Life, <hi>which the Son of Man ſhall give you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They immediately asked him, what VVorks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, they muſt do, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154149:63"/> this Food. He anſwered them, <hi>This is the Work of God, to believe on him, whom he hath ſent.</hi> But ſay they, what Miracle doſt thou Work, that we may believe on thee? Our Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderneſs, which the Scripture calls the Bread of Heaven: As if they had ſaid, Thou haſt indeed Fed 500 Men; but thou didſt it but once: <hi>Moſes</hi> fed Six Hundred Thouſand Men, for Forty Years together with Manna, that fell from Heaven. Canſt thou do any thing greater than <hi>Moſes</hi> did? Jeſus anſwered them, verily I ſay unto you, Moſes <hi>did not give you the true Bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but 'tis my Father that giveth it; and this Bread is he, that came down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World.</hi> They, ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord, give us this Bread for ever.</hi> He anſwered them: <hi>I am the Bread of Life, he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> By which words we are to underſtand, That Jeſus is the ſpiritual Food of thoſe Souls that eat him, believing on him by a lively Faith, which works by Love, and by thus eating him, they obtain that happy Life, with which they ſhall be fully and eternally ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Then he adds, that altho' they had ſeen, and been witneſſes of ſo many Miracles, which he had done, yet they did not believe on him, and by reaſon of their Infidelity they ſhould loſe the great advantage, which all thoſe, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bring unto him ſhould enjoy, <hi>viz.</hi> to be raiſed up at the Laſt Day, and inherit eternal Life. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Jews</hi> murmured againſt him, ſaying, <hi>Is not this the Son of</hi> Joſeph? <hi>Do not we know his Father and Mother? Why then doth he tell us, that he came down from Heaven?</hi> Jeſus was ſo far from mollifying or recanting theſe Truths, tho' they were offended at them, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he confirms them more ſtrongly, and having
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154149:63"/> proved from Scripture, that they ſhould be taught of God; that all, whom his Father teacheth, ſhall come unto him, and that they themſelves did not come unto him, becauſe they did not underſtand the Voice of him that ſent him, He tells them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that he is <hi>the Bread of Life;</hi> that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na did not keep them from dying, who eat of it; but his fleſh was the true Bread, that came down from Heaven, which giveth Life to all that eat of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words made them the more averſe to him, and they diſputed among themſelves, how he could give them his Fleſh to eat? Nevertheleſs, he purſued his Diſcourſe and tells them, <hi>that his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed,</hi> that they have no Life in them, if they eat not his Fleſh, and drink his Blood; and that he that feeds on them, ſhall be raiſed up at the Laſt Day, and obtain eternal Life. Laſtly, he teaches them what great effects his Body ſhould work in the Souls of all thoſe that receive it worthily, ſaying to them, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him, and he ſhall live by me, as I live by my Father, which hath ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſublime Truths, which he taught in the Synagogue at <hi>Capernaum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> offended many of the <hi>Jews;</hi> yea, ſeveral of his Diſciples, having hard them, ſaid, Theſe words are very heard, and unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, who can patiently hear ſuch Doctrin as this, much leſs believe it? But they underſtood them in a literal, which were meant in a Spiritual ſenſe only. They thought, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that if they eat his fleſh, they muſt cut it in pieces, as the fleſh which is ſold in the Market is. They were not ſenſible, that beſides the manner of eating Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by Faith, they might alſo really eat him in the Euchariſt under the Figure of Bread, a way wherein there is nothing affrighting. But inſtead
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154149:64"/> of believing all, that he, who was the Truth it ſelf, ſaid unto them, by attending to his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they did not underſtand, they were offended at his Speech, and withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from following him, would be his Diſciples no longer.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles were wiſer than theſe deſerters; for Jeſus having ſaid unto them, <hi>Will ye alſo leave me? Peter</hi> anſwered for them all, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhould we go? thou haſt the words of Eternal Life, and we believe and know, that thou art the Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> Nevertheleſs among theſe Twelve, which adhered ſo firmly to him, there was one which ſhould afterwards betray him, which was <hi>Judas Iſcariot:</hi> Jeſus knowing it, foretold the Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Treachery of that Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>Have not I choſen you Twelve?

For this reaſon it was that they ſaid unto Jeſus, <hi>Why do thy Diſciples break the Tradition of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in not waſhing their Hands, when they eat their Food?</hi> Jeſus asked them again, <hi>Why do you your ſelves tranſgreſs the Law of the Lord by following your Traditions?</hi> As for example, Why do you perſwade Children to think that they do a Work acceptable to God in giving him Offerings, altho' they ſuffer their Father and Mother to be in want? thus making them to prefer an Humane Tradition before the Commandment of God, which injoyns Children ſo expreſly to Honour, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thoſe, from whom they have received Life.</p>
                  <p>Then he ſhews them, that notwithſtanding all their Ceremonial obſervances, they wore the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, of whom God ſpeaks by the Prophet <hi>Iſaias; This People honoureth me with their Lips,</hi>

                  <p>All this was tranſacted privately between Jeſus Chriſt and his Diſciples, but he called the People,<note place="margin">Luke 9.23-27.</note> and began to preach before them all, thoſe Truths which <hi>Peter</hi> did not underſtand, when he diſcouraged him from ſuffering Death; for he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it publickly, That if any Man will follow him, he muſt bear his Croſs all his Days: That to lay down his Life for him and the Goſpel, is the only way to be ſaved, and to ſeek ſalvation any other way, is to deſtroy himſelf, and that he gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the World that loſes his own Soul: That he ſhall hereafter come in his Glory, and render to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man according to his Works, and then he will diſown them before his Father, who have been aſhamed of him and his Word before Men: And he adds, That there are ſome among his preſent Hearers, who ſhall not dye till they ſee him in his Kingdom, and in the Greatneſs of his Glory.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154149:68"/> where he went to Prayers; and while he was at Prayers his Face became as radiant and ſhining as the Sun,<note place="margin">Luke 9.28-36.</note> and his Garments as bright as the Light, appeared as white as Snow. The Three Apoſtles in the mean while were aſleep, but when they awoke they ſaw their Maſter Transfigured, <hi>i. e.</hi> clear another Man from what they had ſeen him before, for they ſaw him in that Glory, in which he had promiſed to diſcover himſelf to ſome of them; and they beheld alſo, with him, Two Men full of Majeſty, who talked with him concerning that Death which he ſhould ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> They knew that theſe Two Men were <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> and when they were about going from Jeſus, <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with them, ſaid unto his Maſter, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here, and if thou</hi> pleaſeſt, <hi>let us make Three Tabernacles, One for thee, and One for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and One for</hi> Elias: But as he was thus ſpeaking, ſcarce knowing what he ſaid in his Tranſport, as the Goſpel obſerves, a bright Cloud over-ſhadowed them, and there came a Voice out of the Cloud, which ſpake theſe Words, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> This Cloud and Voice filled the Three Diſciples with ſo great Fear, that they fell on their Faces, to the Earth: But Jeſus came to them, and comforted them, and raiſed them up: Then they lifted up their Eyes, and looking round about, they ſaw no Man, ſave Jeſus only.</p>
                  <p>As they were coming down from the Mountain, he commanded them to tell no Man what they had ſeen, till the Son of Man be riſen from the Dead.

                  <p>The next Day, Jeſus being come to the Place,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.14-21. Mark 9.14-29 Luke 9.37,-42.</note> where the reſt of the Apoſtles were, he met a great multitude of Men, and the Scribes queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning with them: As for the People, as ſoon as they ſaw the Son of God, they ran to him, and ſaluted him, being full of Admiration and Joy. Jeſus then asked the Scribes, What was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Subject of your Diſpute? but at the ſame Time came a certain Man to him, having broke through the Preſs, and kneeling down at his Feet, prayed him to have Pity on his only Son, whom he had brought unto him, becauſe his Diſciples could not cure him. This Child was a Lunatick, and poſſeſſed with a Devil, which made him Dumb and grievouſly tormented him; for when it ſeized upon him, it threw him down upon the Ground, caſt him often into the Fire or Water, and racked him with ſuch violent Convulſions, that he cryeth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:154149:69"/> out, fomes, gnaſhes with his Teeth, and pineth away, and much bruiſing him, hardly departeth from him.</p>
                  <p>The Unbelief of the Jews, who did not as yet firmly believe in Jeſus Chriſt, though they had ſeen ſo many Miracles, was a greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſeaſe than this of the Lunatick, and was often an Impediment to the Miracles which Jeſus would have done. For this Reaſon it is that he would cure that, before he drive out the Devil, and therefore ſmartly touched that Wound, that the Men afflicted with it might feel it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>O faithleſs and perverſe Generation, how long ſhall I be with you,</hi> to convince you? <hi>how long ſhall I ſuffer your Infidelity? will you never believe? Bring him hither to me.</hi> The Child no ſooner ſaw him, but the Devil began to tear him with fierce Convulſions, and threw him down, where he rowled foaming. Jeſus asked his Father, How long it was ſince his Son began to be vexed after this manner? His Father anſwered him, From his Childhood; and added, <hi>If thou canst do any thing, have Pity on us and help us.</hi> Jeſus ſaith unto him, <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> Immediately the Father of the Child cryed out with Tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, i. e.</hi> ſupply all the Defects of my Faith, to make it worthy to obtain a Cure for my Child. Then Jeſus rebuked the Devil, ſaying to him, <hi>Thou Dumb and Deaf Spirit, I command thee to depart out of this Child, and to enter no more into him.</hi> Then the Spirit cryed out, and much tore and rent the Child, and left him almoſt dead; but Jeſus, taking him by the Hand, lifted him up, and delivered him to his Father, perfectly cured: And all that were preſent beheld it with Admiration, and were amazed at the mighty Power of God.</p>

He anſwered them, If any Man deſire to be firſt he ſhall be the laſt of all, and Servant of all. And having called a little Child to him, he took him, and ſet him by him; and taking him up in his Arms, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Except ye become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and that whoſoever ſhall ſo humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he makes himſelf ſmall, as the little Child before them, he ſhall be the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven: And then adds, That who ſo ſhall receive one ſuch little Child in his Name, receiveth him, and he that receiveth him, received him that ſent him.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>John,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> ſaith unto him, Maſter, we ſaw a Man caſting out Devils in thy Name, and we forbad him, becauſe he would

                  <p>The Son of God, although he uſes his utmoſt Endeavours to keep out Scandals and Offences out of his Church,<note place="margin">Matt. 18.15-35. Luke 17.3, 4.</note> yet he will have us keep a due Charity and Compaſſion in our Hearts for thoſe that at any Time are the Cauſes of them: And for this Reaſon it is, that in the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, made to his Diſciples, he gives us moſt excellent Rules to deal with ſuch Offenders by, both as to their Puniſhment and Pardon; for, in the firſt Place, he orders, That he, by whom any Offence cometh, ſhall be admoniſhed in private, by the Perſon offended, that, if it be poſſible, he may be gained by this means; but if a private Admonition have no effect upon him, it muſt be repeated before Two or Three Witneſſes; and if this prove alſo unſucceſsful, and to no purpoſe, we muſt accuſe him to the whole Church, and have no more Society or Commerce with him than with an Heathen and Infidel, if he contemn the Church's, as he hath all private Admonition. And, that the Church may ſeparate all thoſe from her Communion which may obſtruct and hinder the Salvation of her other Children, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her the Authority of Binding and Looſing, aſſuring her, That he will ratify and confirm in Heaven whatſoever ſhe ſhall pronounce and declare upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, he commands, when Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is ſucceſsful, to pardon the Offence receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Seven times a Day, if the offender repents of what he hath done ſo often; <hi>i. e.</hi> that we muſt always forgive him who is penitent and ſorry for his Fault; for <hi>Peter</hi> having asked Jeſus, How often he ought to pardon his Brother? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154149:71"/> he ought to do it Seven Times? Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>I ſay unto thee, not until Seven Times, but until Seventy Times Seven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, to ſhew him the Neceſſity and Advantage of ſuch a merciful Temper, which is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon; he propounds a Parable of a King, who calling his Servants to an account, found One that owed him ſo great a Sum that he was not able to pay it, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten thouſand Talents, or a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion eight hundred and ſeventy five thouſand Pounds; whereupon he commanded him to be ſold, and his Wife and Children, and all that he had: But this Servant falling down at his Feet, begged his Mercy and Patience, and he forgave him the Debt. This Wretch was no ſooner gone out, but he met one of his Fellow-Servants, who owed him a ſmall Debt, <hi>viz.</hi> an Hundred Pence, which is about Three Pounds, Two and Six Pence of our Mony, he takes him by the Throat, and would give him no Time for Payment, though he earneſtly deſired Patience, but caſt him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

Jeſus, who could not ſuffer but at the Time prefixed by his Father, ſaid unto the Officers, <hi>Yet a little while I am with you, and then I return to him that ſent me; ye ſhall ſeek me and ſhall not find me, and whither I go ye cannot come.</hi> The Jews did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Words, but thought that he threatned them to leave <hi>Judea,</hi> and go to teach the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:154149:73"/>
                  <p>The Officers did not take him, becauſe his Time was not come; and, in the laſt Day of the Feaſt, he cried out with a loud Voice, <hi>If any Man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink; Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Water,</hi> which he meant of the abundant Graces of God's Holy Spirit, which ſhould be poured out upon the Souls of thoſe that believe in him, after he ſhould be entred into his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the People were much divided in their Opinions about this Saying, for ſome took him for a Prophet, others acknowledged him for the Meſſias, and others, who knew not that he was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> could not believe him to be the Chriſt, becauſe they knew that Chriſt ſhould not come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> but out of the Town of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> and from the Family of <hi>David.</hi> Then the Prieſts and Phariſees asked the Officers, whom they had ſent to take him, Why they had not brought him? They gave them no other Anſwer but this; <hi>Never Man ſpake like this Man.</hi> The Phariſees asked them, If they were ſo ſimple as to be lead away with ſuch a Seducement, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Error of the curſed Populacy, leaving the Phariſees and Grandees, who being Learned and Judicious, have none of them believed on him?</p>
                  <p>Upon this, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that Phariſee that came to Jeſus Chriſt by Night, told them, That the Law doth not permit them to condemn any Man before an Hearing. But they anſwered him, Art thou alſo a Galilean, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Diſciple of this Man of <hi>Galilee?</hi> From whence they affirmed, That there never was a Prophet that roſe out of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Thus the Aſſembly parted, without doing any thing to him; and every Man returned to his own Houſe.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> hated Jeſus every day more and more,<note place="margin">Jo. 8.12-59.</note> but that did not deterr him from Preaching the Truth undauntedly to all. He tells them, <hi>That he is the Light of the World, and if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, they ſhall not walk in Darkneſs.</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Phariſees replyed, that the Teſtimony, which he gave of himſelf, was not worthy of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But he demonſtrates, that they judged amiſs, and the Teſtimony which he gave of himſelf, was not therefore leſs to be believed, becauſe it was confirmed by the Teſtimony of his Father, who wrought ſo great Miracles by him. They then asked him, <hi>Where his Father was?</hi> He anſwered them, <hi>That they knew not his Father,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not acknowledge his Son. He added moreover and ſaid, <hi>I go my way, and ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall dy in your Sins, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> And becauſe they thought he would kill himſelf, that they might not follow him, hereupon he tells them, <hi>That he was not from below,</hi> as they are, <hi>but from above,</hi> and that if they did not believe in him, <hi>they ſhould dye in their Sins.</hi> They then asked him, <hi>Who he was?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>That he was the Son of God?</hi> but in ſuch words, as they did not underſtand. He adds, That when they have lifted him up on high (by which he means the Croſs, to which he was to be faſtned) they ſhould believe him, and know, that he had done nothing of himſelf, nor ſaid any thing but what he hath heard of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Truths, which blinded the Proud, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned ſeveral other Perſons, who believed on him, to whom he ſaid, <hi>That if they would continue firm in the Obſervation of his Word, then they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154149:75"/> ſhould be his Diſciples indeed. That they ſhould know the Truth, and the Truth ſhould make them free.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> reply'd that they never were Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>but free,</hi> as being the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> He anſwers them, <hi>That every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Sin, is the Servant of Sin,</hi> and that they could not be truly free, unleſs he made them free. That they were indeed <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children according to the fleſh, but that in rejecting the Truth and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Kill him, who had told them the Truth, they did not do like <hi>Abraham,</hi> but made themſelves the Children of another Father, by following his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and imitating him. They maintain'd, that in that ſenſe they had no other Father but God; but Jeſus tells them again, That if they were the Children of God, they would hear God's Word, and Love his only begotten Son, <hi>whom he hath ſent.</hi> That Murther and Lying being the Works of the Devil, thoſe People, who ſought to deſtroy a Man, whom they could not prove Guilty of any Crime, and who had told them the Truth, had the Devil for their Father. They made no reply to this, but by railing at him. Calling him a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> that hath a Devil. Jeſus anſwered them plainly, <hi>I have not a Devil, but honour my Father;</hi> adding, that there is another that will do him Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeketh not his own Glory. Afterwards he ſaith, <hi>That he that keeps his Word ſhall never dye,</hi> which he means of Eternal Death. But the <hi>Jews,</hi> who underſtood it of the Death of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, took occaſion to inſult over him, asking him, <hi>Whether he was greater than</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> that he could preſerve them from Death, that keep his Commandments, which theſe great Men could not avoid, and therefore deſire him to tell them, what manner of Man he would have them to take him for. He anſwers them again, That he honoured not himſelf, but derived all his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154149:75"/> Honour from his Father, whom they worſhipped as their God, but know him not. That as for <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom they were always bragging of, he had earneſtly deſired to ſee the Coming of him, whom they contemned, which he ſaw, and was filled with great Joy. They replyed, <hi>Thou art not yet Fifty Years Old, and haſt thou ſeen</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham? He anſwered them, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am.</hi> Upon this they took up Stones to caſt at him, but he hid himſelf, and went out of the Temple eſcaping the Fury of his Enemies for that time, that he might expoſe himſelf to all their Malice and Rage, when his time appointed by his Father for him to ſuffer, was come.</p>

                  <p>Jeſus, as he paſſed the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 9.1-41.</note> ſaw a Man ſitting in the Streets, who was Blind from his Birth, and his Diſciples asked him, whether it was his own, or his Parents Sin, that was the cauſe of his Blindneſs? He anſwered them, that he was not made Blind for any Sin, that either himſelf, or his Parents had committed, but that God might manifeſt the more the wonderful Works of his Power. He adds, that it is his Office to do theſe Works, in the time allowed him for it, and that ſo long, as he is in the World, <hi>he is the Light of the World.</hi> After this anſwer, <hi>He ſpat on the Ground, and having made Clay with the ſpittle, he rubbed the eyes of the Blind Man with it, and ſent him to waſh them, to the Pool,</hi> called the Pool of <hi>Silom,</hi> where as ſoon as he had waſhed, <hi>he ſaw clearly.</hi> His Neighbours, and all thoſe that knew him when he was Blind, and ſat in the Streets beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, could not believe what they ſaw, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether he was the ſame Man, or one like him. But he told them all, that it was he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154149:76"/> And further related to them, <hi>That a Man called Jeſus had reſtored his ſight.</hi> They asked him, <hi>where he was?</hi> but he ſaying, <hi>that he could not tell,</hi> they carryed him to the Phariſees, who alſo themſelves examined him, and he related to them, how the thing happened.</p>
                  <p>It was the Sabboth-day, on which Jeſus healed this Blind Man, which was the cauſe, that ſome of the Phariſees ſaid, <hi>This Man is not of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he keepeth not the Sabboth.</hi> But others could not believe that a Wicked Man could do ſo great Miracles, ſo that there was a great Diviſion among them. Then they asked the Blind Man, what he thought himſelf? He anſwered, that he looked upon Jeſus <hi>as a Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe things much aſtoniſhed the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they would not believe it, till they had called the Father and Mother of the Blind Man of whom they enquired, <hi>Is this your Son, whom ye ſay was born Blind? how then doth he ſee clearly?</hi> But they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Jews,</hi> and knowing the Reſolution, that they had made, to put every Man out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, who ſhould acknowledge, <hi>that Jeſus was Chriſt,</hi> anſwered freely, <hi>We know that this is our Son, and that he was born Blind, but we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by what means he ſeeth, or who hath opened his Eyes: He is of Age, ask him, he ſhall anſwer for himſelf.</hi> Wherefore they called the Blind Man the ſecond time, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Give God the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we know that this Man is a Sinner, and a Wicked Man.</hi> He anſwered them, <hi>I cannot tell whether he be a ſinner;</hi> but this I know, that whereas I was Blind, <hi>I now ſee clearly.</hi> They asked him again, <hi>how he had received his ſight?</hi> And he anſwered them, <hi>I have already told, and ye did not mind it, why would you hear it again? Are you deſirous to be his Diſciples?</hi> Then were they enraged againſt him, and reproaching him, ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art one
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154149:76"/> of his Diſciples, but we are</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Diſciples. For we know that God ſpake to</hi> Moſes, <hi>but as for this Man, we knew not whence he is.</hi> The Blind Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That it was very ſtrange, that they ſhould not know, that a Man, who hath ſo Miraculouſly opened the Eyes of one Born Blind, a thing the like to which was never heard of ſince the World began, muſt needs be from God. At this they caſt him out of their Aſſembly with diſgrace, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou wast altogether born in Sin, and doſt thou undertake to teach us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeſus heard that they had thus expelled him, and meeting him he ſaid unto him, <hi>Dost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Son of God?</hi> He anſwered him, <hi>Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</hi> Jeſus ſaith unto him, <hi>Thou haſt ſeen him, and it is he that ſpeaketh to thee:</hi> He anſwered him, <hi>Lord I believe, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fell down at his Feet, and Worſhipped him, as the Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeſus adds, that he came into the World to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe an amazing Judgment, that the Blind may ſee, and they that ſee, may become Blind, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they whoſe Pride hinders them from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their Spiritual Blindneſs may be blinded ſo as not to ſee the Truth: for ſome of the Phariſees having demanded of him, whether they alſo were blind? He anſwered them, <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no Sin,</hi> but becauſe ye aſſert that ye ſee, <hi>therefore your Sin remaineth.</hi> As if he had ſaid according to the explication of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> If ye were ſenſible of your Blindneſs, ye would deſire Cure, and he would pardon your Sins; but your Sins remain, becauſe you are Wiſe and Holy in your own conceit, and ſo think you have no need of any Perſon to Illuminate and Sanctify you.</p>

And he explains this ſimilitude, which they did not underſtand, by telling them, <hi>that he was the Door,</hi> by which we muſt enter upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Flock. There are others, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred by the Door, guide and rule the Flock as Mercenaries and Hirelings, who forſake the Flock, as ſoon as they ſee the Wolf coming, becauſe they love themſelves only, and not the Flock. There are alſo the Good Shepherds, who enter not of themſelves into the Sheep-fold, <hi>But the Porter opens to them, who know the Sheep, and are known of them, and who love them ſo, as to lay down their Lives for them, upon Occaſions.</hi> Jeſus then applies all the qualities of this laſt, and proves himſelf to be the Good Shepherd, by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, ſince he came to lay down his Life for the Sheep, and that willingly and freely, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Fathers Commandment: For no Man can take it away from him, and when he hath layd it down, he can take it up again, and none can hinder him. Then he declares, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were not the only Sheep, for whom he would dye; that he had other Sheep, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom he would bring into his Fold, and out of both would make up one Flock, conſiſting of ſuch as hear his

                  <p>But Jeſus doth not content himſelf to teach us to hearken to the Word of God,<note place="margin">Luke 11.1,-13.</note> by the example of <hi>Mary,</hi> but alſo he directs us how to ſpeak to God in Prayer; for upon a certain day, one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſeeing him at prayer, after he had finiſhed,

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154149:79"/> long Prayers, they devoured, and ruined Widows, into whoſe Houſes they inſinuated themſelves by that means; Becauſe they would Travel into all places to convert Infidels to the Jews Religion and afterward make them more worthy of Hell, than themſelves, either by their wicked example, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to prophane the True Religion, which they had brought them over to, or elſe ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing them by their ſinful Lives, that they choſe to return to that Pagan Worſhip they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; Becauſe they undertake to Guide, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others, but are themſelves ſo Ignorant and Blind, as to teach Men, that they are obliged to keep their words, when they ſwear by the Gift beſtowed upon the Temple, or offered on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but are not obliged, when they ſwear by the Temple, or Altar themſelves. He compares them therefore to thoſe Sepulchres, which have fine white out-ſides, but are within full of Dead-mens Bones, and Rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyers thought that all theſe Reproofs equally concerned them; wherefore one of them taking upon him to ſpeak to Jeſus, ſaid to him, <hi>Maſter, in thus ſpeaking, thou diſgracest <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s alſo.</hi> But he ſpared them no more than the former, but pronounced alſo a <hi>Wo</hi> againſt them, becauſe they impoſe a Yoke upon others, which they will not touch with the Tip of their Fingers, and that they will neither enter into Heaven themſelves, not ſuffer thoſe that would. He tells them alſo by way of reproach, that thoſe very Magnificent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, with which they adorned the Sepulchres of the Prophets, as a Demonſtration of their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the Fact of thoſe Men, who were their Murderers, were contrary to their deſign evident Marks of their Approbation of their Crime, ſince by Perſecuting thoſe, who Preached the Truth to them, they imitated their Malice ſo exactly,

Then did a certain Man of the Company ſay unto him, <hi>Maſter, ſpeak to my Brother, to divide the Inheritance fallen to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with me.</hi> But Jeſus deſirous to teach Us that 'tis every Mans Duty to keep within his own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, anſwered him, my Friend, <hi>who made me a Judge, or a Divider among you?</hi> Then he ſubjoyns, <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> and to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154149:80"/> this the more into the Hearts of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, he propounded to them this Parable; <hi>A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rich Man, being troubled for a place, where to lay up the extraordinary plenty, which his Land had produced, reſolved to pull down his Barns, and Build bigger, and when he had thus ſecured, and layd up his Goods, he ſaid within himſelf, that having a ſufficient Proviſion for many Years, he had nothing to do, but take his eaſe, and be merry.</hi> But God ſaid to this Man, <hi>O thou Fool, This Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and for whom then haſt thou hoarded up theſe things? Such is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of him, that layeth up Treaſure for himſelf, and is not Rich towards God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this reaſon it is, that he teaches his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not to be ſollicitous, or careful for the things of this Life; but to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, and God will give all other things to them; That they ſhould be ſo far from heaping up Riches, that they ought to ſell all that they have, and give it to the Poor, that they may have a Treaſure in Heaven; That they are indeed but a ſmall number, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, they ſhould not be afraid, ſince it is their Fathers good will to give them the Kingdom. He tells them further, that they ſhould always be in a readineſs to appear before God, who will come at an Hour, when they leaſt expect him, as Servants, who watch all Night, waiting for the return of their Maſter from the Wedding. That being made Stewards of Gods Houſe, to diſtribute to his People the Food of his Word, they ſhould diſcharge their Duty faithfully, not doing as the Fooliſh Steward, who ſeeing his Lord to delay his coming, conſumed the Goods he had been Truſted withal, in Debaucheries, made uſe of his Authority to abuſe his fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and deſerved for his irregular Management
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:154149:81"/> to be caſt with Hypocrites and Unbelievers, into that place of Torment, where there is nothing but wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth. That ſince the Son of Man will come in a Day and Hour, which they know not of, to require an Account of their Management, they ſhould always watch, as a Maſter of an Houſe would do, if he knew what Night the Thief would come to Rob, and Plunder his Houſe. That knowing the Will of their Maſter, they are ſo much the more to blame, if they do not obey it; and the more they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted withall, the greater their account will be. And we ſee that elſewhere he gives them this important Inſtruction;<note place="margin">Luke 17.10.</note> That after that they had done all, that they are commanded, they ſhould be ſo far from being proud of it, that they ought to look upon themſelves, as unprofitable Servants, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they have done no more, than what they are obliged to do.</p>
                  <p>He adviſes them to be very careful in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Miniſtry faithfully, becauſe in ſo doing, they ſhall be dealt well withall by all the World; whereas on the contrary, he came to bring diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Earth, ſo that the Perſons of the ſame Family ſhall be at enmity with one another, ſome deſiring to follow Jeſus Chriſt, others Perſecuting thoſe that adhere to him.

He tells, that it was not reaſonable to think ſo, but that the concluſion, that they ought to make from that accident, is this, That unleſs they repented they ſhould all come to as ſad and untimely ends as thoſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men.</p>

In like manner, if a Woman, who hath Ten Pieces of Silver, loſe one of them, doth ſhe not ſweep all the Houſe to find it, and having found it, rcjoyces with her Neighbours? He then tells them, That as the Sheep and Piece of Silver, being found again, cauſe greater Joy than all the reſt, that were not loſt, ſo there is great Joy in Heaven at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner.</p>
                  <p>This Truth he further explains by another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſaying, There was a Man who had Two Sons, and the Younger of them having received that Portion of his Goods which came to his ſhare, went into a far Country, to ſpend it in Lewdneſs and Debauchery: After he had conſumed and devoured all, he was forced to keep Swine to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154149:85"/> get a Livelihood; and, in this condition, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Miſery, he reſolved to return again to his Father, and humbly acknowledging his Fault, beg his Favour to entertain him again, as a Domeſtick Servant. As ſoon as his Father ſaw him, he was affected with Joy and Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and running to him, fell on his Neck and kiſſed him, while the Son, not at all elevated with his Kindneſs, under the Senſe of ſo much Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, ſaid unto him; <hi>Father, I have ſinned against Heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be called thy Son:</hi> This humble Confeſſion wrought an entire Reconciliation to his Father, who, having ſtripped him of his Rags, and put on him a good Habit, made a magnificent Feaſt in his Houſe, to rejoyce for his Return. This Action much diſpleaſed the Elder Brother, who return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Field, would not go into the Houſe, becauſe his Father had done more for his Lewd Brother than he had ever done for him, though he had always been very faithful in his Duty towards him. This being objected to his Father, he ſaid, <hi>My Son, Thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine,</hi> but it was neceſſary for me to Feaſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, <hi>becauſe this thy Brother was dead and is alive again, was loſt and is found.</hi> The Application of this Parable is very eaſy; by the Diſcontent of the Elder Son we are to underſtand the unjuſt Murmurs of the Phariſees, who were very angry with Jeſus for entertaining Sinners, though the main End of his coming into the World was to ſave Sinners.</p>

                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt propounds another Parable to his Diſciples, and makes a Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Luke 16.1-31.</note> wherein he takes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154149:86"/> occaſion to reprove the Covetouſneſs of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as he had done their Envy and Pride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaying to his Diſciples; There was a certain Rich Man, who had reſolved to call his Steward to an account, and to put him out of his Place, becauſe he had received an Accuſation againſt him, that he had embezled his Goods: The Steward ſeeing himſelf in danger of being reduced to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, or ſuch Labour as he could not undergo, contrived this Way to make up his Loſs; he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all his Lord's Debtors, one after another, to him, and diſcharged them of a Part of their Debts, permitting him that owed an Hundred Barrels of Oyl to ſet down but Fifty in his Bill, and him that owed an Hundred Meaſures to make it but Fourſcore, and proportionably the reſt. Jeſus Chriſt teaches his Diſciples, not to imitate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, but Craft of this Steward, employing their earthly Riches to make them Friends in the Perſon of the Poor, and by that means to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting Habitations in Heaven; and ſo the Children of Light may not be leſs prudent in things that reſpect their Salvation than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World are in the management of their Temporal Affairs.</p>
                  <p>Then he teaches them to be faithful in ſmall things, that they may be entruſted with great, and not to be ſlaves to Mony and Riches, which he calls <hi>the Mammon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Goods, either becauſe there is nothing but Wickedneſs, which can make them to be looked upon as ſubſtantial good Things, able to make the Poſſeſſors of them happy, or becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Injuſtice makes Men to look upon them, as their own; for in the Senſe of Scripture we are but Stewards under God, and not Maſters of them.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:154149:86"/>
                  <p>The covetous Phariſees heard theſe Truths with contempt, and derided the Speaker of them; but Jeſus knew how to check their Scoffs, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Hypocriſy of their outward Vertues, for he told them, That notwithſtanding all their Caution to appear Righteous, God knew their Hearts, to whom ſuch Things, as are admired and commended by Men, are hateful and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                  <p>He then teaches them, what ſhall be the End and Puniſhment of that Covetouſneſs, which makes them Deaf to his Reproof, and ſo obdurate againſt the Poor, by an Example of a certain Rich Man, who was cloathed in Purple and fine Linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every Day, without being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the leaſt Compaſſion for thoſe who were wholly deſtitute of Food; for there was a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, named <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a Man ſo infirm and diſeaſed that he was covered all over with Sores; this Man was laid at the Rich Man's Gate, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only to be fed with the Scraps that came from his Table, but could not obtain that Piece of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from this hard-hearted Miſer, whoſe Dogs were more merciful than he, for they came and licked his Sores, and ſo by their healing Tongues did what they could to cure his Diſeaſe: At length they both dyed, but their End was as different as their Lives had been, for the Poor Man was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by the Angels, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, <hi>i. e.</hi> into a Place of Happineſs, appointed for the Souls of the Saints; the Rich Man alſo dyed, and was buried in his Body, but his Soul was carried into Hell. From hence he beholding the Happineſs of the Beggar, whom he had contemned, cryed out, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have Mercy on me, and ſend</hi> Lazarus, <hi>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water, and cool my Tongue,</hi> for I ſuffer inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Torments in this Flame.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154149:87"/> told him, that it was impoſſible, by reaſon of the vaſt diſtance between them to grant his Requeſt, ſo it was juſt that he, who had endured ſo much Grief and Sorrow in his Life-time, ſhould receive Comfort and Happineſs after his Death; but as for himſelf, who had ſurfeited with the Delights and Pleaſures of this Life, that he ſhould ſuffer Thirſt and Torments in another World. The Rich Man perceiving that there was no Mercy to be hoped for, for himſelf, thought of his Five Brethren, which yet lived in the ſame Luxury and Riot, and prayed <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend them Word by <hi>Lazarus</hi> of the miſerable Condition he was in, that by his Example they might grow wiſer and repent. But he anſwered them, That they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and if they neglected to hear them, they would not give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a Dead Man, though raiſed on purpoſe to warn them of their Duty.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:154149:95"/> to the laſt the Government of Five Gities, and the other of Ten: But one there was among them, who inſtead of trading with it, had lock'd it up, fearing, as he ſaid, the great Severity of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo, not daring to hazard what he had entruſted to him.

The Apoſtles, but chiefly <hi>Judas</hi> Iſcariot, murmured at this waſte, and <hi>Judas</hi> ſaid, That this Oyntment might have been ſold for Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pence (which is about 9<hi>l.</hi> 7<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) and ſo relieved many Poor People; not that he had ſo much Care or Compaſſion for the Poor (as the Goſpel obſerves) but becauſe he was a Thief and kept the Mony, which Jeſus Chriſt had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for his ordinary Expence, and for the maintenance of the Poor, upon which account it was that he was ſo very deſirous to have gotten the Price of this Oyntment into his Hands, that he might gratify his own Covetouſneſs. But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelf undertook the Defence of <hi>Mary,</hi> and told thoſe that condemned her, That ſhe had done a good Work, and had embalmed his Body before-hand, for the Day of its Burial; and that as for the Poor, for whoſe Relief it was ſaid, that the Price of this Oyntment might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed; they were always with them, and might receive Relief of them at any Time, but they cculd not have him always with them, to pay their Duty to him, and give him the Marks of their Eſteem and Affection: And laſtly, That this Action of <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſhould in every Place, where the Goſpel is preach'd, be ſpoken of in her Commendation. In the mean while, it being known at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Jeſus was come to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany,</hi> many of the Jews came to ſee him, and not him only, but more eſpecially <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he had raiſed from the Dead.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154149:98"/> Maſter. Jeſus, who by his Death was about to obtain Salvation, as well for the Gentiles as Jews, anſwered theſe Two Apoſtles, That his Hour was come that he ſhould be glorified: And as a Grain of Wheat brings forth no Fruit till it is dead in the Earth, where it is ſown, ſo ſhould his Death be the Seed, which ſhould produce a great Harveſt; that the Faithful, which ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereby, ſhould learn by his Example to hate their Lives in this World, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it to Life Eternal, and that the Service, which they ſhould pay him, in following him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth, ſhould be rewarded with Eternal Glory. He alſo, for their Comfort, brought upon himſelf the Horrors of his Death, and therefore ſtirred up voluntarily a Paſſion in his Soul, which diſcovered it ſelf outwardly by theſe Words, <hi>My Soul is troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Father ſave me from this Hour:</hi> But conſidering with himſelf how great Glory God would gain by his Death, he added; <hi>But for this Cauſe came I to this Hour: Father, glorify thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time there came a Voice from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>I have glorified it already, and will glorify it again.</hi> They, that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſaid, That it was a Clap of Thunder, and others ſaid, That an Angel ſpake unto him, but he anſwered, <hi>This Voice came not for me, but for your ſakes.</hi> And to let them know what Influence his Death, which he ſhould ſuffer upon the Croſs, ought to have upon all Men, he ſaith, <hi>Now is this World judged, and the Prince of this World, i. e.</hi> the Devil, <hi>is cast out; and when I am lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all Men unto me.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the Jews asked him, How the Death of the Son of Man could be conſonant with the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which ſaith, <hi>That Christ muſt endure for ever, and never dye?</hi> And they added, <hi>Who is this Son of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154149:98"/> Man?</hi> He anſwers them, That they ſhould enjoy the Light a little Time; and adviſes them, That ſince it is no fit Time to walk or act, when they are deprived of it, they ſhould believe in the Light, that is, in him, ſo long as he is with them.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus having ſpoke theſe Words,<note place="margin">John 12.36-50</note> hid himſelf from them, ſince they made no deeper Impreſſion upon their Hearts than his Miracles did, which he had done before them in ſo great Numbers; for they were ſtricken with that Blindneſs of Heart, which according to <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy,<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.9.</note> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from ſeeing that which they ſaw, their Hearts being ſo much hardened that they could not endure the Remedies which were applyed for their Cure. Nevertheleſs, even among the Chief Men of the Jewiſh Nation, there were ſeveral that belived on Jeſus Chriſt, but they dare not own him openly, becauſe the Phariſees had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put all Jeſus's Diſciples out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and this their cowardly Timorouſneſs proceeded from hence, That they loved the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God: So that it was in vain for Jeſus to cry out to theſe ſort of Perſons, as he doth in the next Words; <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth on him that ſent me: I am come a Light into the World, that whoſoever believeth in me may not abide in Darkneſs: I am come to ſave and not to judge; he that diſregards my Words ſhall be judged by the ſame Word at the Laſt Day; for I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, nor taught any thing but what my Father commanded me to teach:</hi> So great an effect had their Fear and Hardneſs upon them.</p>

                  <p>After he hath thus inſtructed them concerning what ſhould befal themſelves, he then tells them, what ſhall come upon the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, and the Jews themſelves.

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26.1-5.14-16 Mar. 14.1, 2, 10, 11 Luke 22.1-6.</note>While Jeſus was thus inſtructing his Apoſtles, the Prieſts and Doctors of the Law were deviſing all ways to apprehend Jeſus by Subtilty, and put him to Death. He did not hide himſelf from them, becauſe his Hour was come: He appeared in the Temple in the Day-Time, and the People came together, early in the Morning, to hear him, and at Night he went into the <hi>Mount of Olives.</hi> On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> his Enemies met in the Hall of <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High Prieſt, and held a Council againſt him:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:154149:107"/> But becauſe they feared the People, they ſought to ſeize upon him by Craft, and that not on he Feaſt-Day, leſt they ſhould cauſe an Uproar among the People. In the mean Time Satan entred the Heart of <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> that covetous Apoſtle, who, being a Thief, kept the Mony of Jeſus Chriſt, and inſpired him with a deteſtable Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to betray and ſell his Maſter. This Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor therefore goes to the Prieſts and Rulers, and ſaith unto them, <hi>What will ye give me, and I will deliver him into your Hands?</hi> This Propoſition did pleaſe them wonderfully, and they promiſed to give him Thirty Pieces of Silver, which comes to about Three Pounds and Fifteen Shillings of our Mony; Which Sum he accepted: From that Time he ſought Opportunity to betray him. This Jeſus warned his Diſciples of, <hi>Ye know that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Two Days is the Feaſt of the Paſſover, and the Son of Man ſhall be delivered up to the Jews, to be Crucified.</hi>

                     <hi>XXI.</hi> What was the Jewiſh Paſſover.</head>
                  <p>The Paſſover was the greateſt and moſt ſolemn of all the Jewiſh Feſtivals,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> and God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, as a notable Remembrance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had done for his People; and as a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Sign of thoſe that he further intended to do for all Mankind, by the Death of his Son. The Word <hi>Paſcha</hi> ſignifies a Paſſage; and if we would underſtand why this Name was given to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, we muſt call to Mind the manner how the Iſraelites were delivered out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and from the Slavery of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> God, that he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige that Prince to free his People, ſent ſeveral Plagues upon him and his Kingdom, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſlew all the Firſt-Born in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> both of Man and Beaſt: But that the Jews might not be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154149:108"/> involved in this Maſſacre, which was intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to work their Deliverance, they were ordered by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God to do theſe Things. On the Tenth Day of the Moon in <hi>March,</hi> they took eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one an He-Lamb, according to their Families, without Blemiſh or Spot, which they Sacrific'd on the Full-Moon of the ſame Month, at Even, and ſtruct the Blood of it upon the Lintel and Two Side-poſts of their Houſes. The ſame Night they eat the Fleſh roaſted with Fire, in haſte, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread and bitter Sauces, having their Garments guirded and truſſed up, their Shoes on their Feet, and a Staff in their Hands, as being ready to depart. In this Night, which was from the Fourteenth to the Fifteenth Day of the Moon in March, God laid this heavy Judgment upon all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in ſlaying all the Firſt-born; and becauſe he paſſed over all the Houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which he ſaw dyed with the Blood of the Lamb, which had been ſacrificed the Night before, he would have this Lamb called by the Name of <hi>Paſcha,</hi> or <hi>Paſſover.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſeeng this Slaughter, urged the Jews to be gone themſelves, who being ready to depart, as we have already ſeen, went out of that Country, carrying the Dough along with them, which they had not Time to leaven. In remembrance of this miraculous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, God commanded them to celebrate a great Feaſt every Year, called the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> that they might have it, as a Monument of this Paſſage of the Lord; and he enjoyned them, during this Solemnity, which was to continue Seven Days, That they ſhould eat unleavened Bread, and ſhould begin on the Fourteenth Day of the Moon of <hi>March,</hi> in the Evening, to Sacrifice and Eat the Lamb, in remembrance of their Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This Evening, which began the Feaſt of Paſſover, was called the Firſt Day of Unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154149:108"/> Bread, and the Name of <hi>Paſſover</hi> was given equally to the Lamb that was eaten, and to the Solemnity which began with the Sacrifice of that Lamb: Whence it comes to paſs, that we often meet with ſuch Expreſſions as theſe in the Goſpel, to Eat, Sacrifice and Keep the Paſſover. As the Bondage of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from which God delivered the Jews, was a Figure of Man's Slavery to Sin, from which he was about to free Men, ſo the Lamb, whoſe Blood ſaved the Iſraelites, is a Figure of Jeſus Chriſt, who is called, <hi>The True Paſſover,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis by his Blood that we are truly redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And for this Reaſon it is, that he would dye at the Paſſover, to fulfil by his Sacrifice the great Myſteries which were repreſented by all the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ceremonies.</p>

                     <note place="margin">John 13.1-15.</note>From this Time Jeſus had his Death continually in his Thoughts, which ſeems to have been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this Feaſt of the Paſſover, which ſignifies a Paſſage, to put him in Mind that his Hour was come, wherein he was to paſs out of this World to his Father. He knew that the Devil had put into the Heart of <hi>Judas</hi> Iſcariot a Deſign to betray him; but before he was delivered into the Hands of his Enemies, he was deſirous to give his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whom he had always loved, and would love unto the end, a ſignal Teſtimony of his Love; wherefore he riſeth from the Table, layeth aſide his Garments, takes a Towel, pours Water into a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and knowing that his Father had given all Things into his Hands, and that he was come from God and went to God, he goes about to waſh his Apoſtles Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel he had about him: <hi>Peter</hi> could not endure this great Debaſement of his Maſter, and ſays unto him in a Surprize, <hi>Why wilt thou waſh my Feet, Lord?</hi> And although Jeſus anſwered him, Thou knoweſt not now what I do, but thou ſhalt know afterward; yet he ſtill aſſerted, <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my Feet.</hi> But becauſe his Maſter told him, That if he waſhed him not, he ſhould have no part in him, he choſe rather to ſee him do ſo mean an Office than be ſeparated from him, and therefore replyed, <hi>Lord, not only my Feet, but my Hands and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154149:109"/> my Feet.</hi> Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>He that hath been waſhed already, hath no need to waſh any part of him but his Feet; and ye are clean, but not all:</hi> Under which Exception he marked out <hi>Judas,</hi> who being his Diſciple ſhould betray him. This Anſwer makes it credible, that Jeſus did waſh his Apoſtles Feet, not only to give them a ſignal Example of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, but to ſhew us, that although we are puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Baptiſm, yet in this Life we have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual need to cleanſe our Affections, which are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in Human Affairs; in the ſame manner as our Feet, how clean ſoever the reſt of our Body is, do continually gather Soil and Filth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only need waſhing. After he had waſhed his Apoſtles Feet, he took his Garments, and ſitting down at the Table, he ſaith unto them, <hi>Know ye what I have done unto you? ye call me Lord and Maſter, and 'tis reaſonable you ſhould, for ſo I am; if I then, your Lord and Maſter, have waſhed your Feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye may conſider upon it, and do as I have done unto you.</hi>

Jeſus then ask'd them, Whether they wanted any thing, when he ſent them without Purſe, or Scrip, or Shoes? And when they anſwered him <hi>No,</hi> he ſaid to them, <hi>But now, he that hath a Purſe or a Scrip, let him take it, and he that hath no Sword, let him ſell his Garment and buy one.</hi> In which figurative Language he deſcribes the Greatneſs of the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which they muſt ſhortly undergo, that it ſhould be ſo violent, that if they fly to ſuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means, as are uſually made uſe of, they muſt ſell their very Garments to provide Arms for their Defence; <hi>For I ſay unto you,</hi> adds he, <hi>that this must be accompliſhed,</hi>

He anſwered him, <hi>If any Man love me, he will keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and make our Abode with him: He that loveth me not, keepeth not my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> He enlarges no farther upon <hi>Judas</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. but leaves us to infer from his Anſwer, That the Reaſon why he doth not diſcover himſelf to the World. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Lovers of the World, is, becauſe the World neither loves nor keeps his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

                  <p>Theſe Truths the Apoſtles heard with ſilence, as if they were much afflicted, and aſtoniſhed at the loſs of their Maſter Jeſus Chriſt: He told them, that he was going to him that ſent him, and none of them asked, whither he went, but were only troubled at it. He mildly reproves this their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to comfort them, he tells them, it was for their Intereſt that he ſhould go away, becauſe he could not ſend the Spirit, who is the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till after his departure from them: That when this Comforter is come, he will convince the World, and Principally the Jews of Sin, in not believing in him, whom God hath ſent to ſave them; of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, either of Jeſus Chriſt, which was manifeſt by his Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, or of the Faithful, who have believed in him, and have not ſeen him, whom the Jews having ſeen, have not believed on him: That he will convince the World of the Judgment, and Condemnation of the Prince of this World, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Devil, whoſe Kingdom hath been deſtroyed by Jeſus Chriſt, and of whoſe puniſhment all thoſe ſhall fall into, who will not free themſelves from his Slavery and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that they may ſubmit to the Command and Power of Chriſt: That this ſame Spirit of Truth, ſhall make the Apoſtles underſtand all the Truths, that they have heard, and ſhall teach them thoſe Doctrins, which he could not inſtruct them in, becauſe they were not able to bear them.</p>
                  <p>Then he adds, <hi>Yet a little while and ye ſhall ſee me no more;</hi> and again, <hi>a little while and ye ſhall ſee me, becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> His Diſciples
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:154149:113"/> did not underſtand the meaning of theſe Words, but asked one another what he intended by them, and were deſirous to ask him himſelf. Jeſus perceiving this, tells them, <hi>that they ſhall weep, but the World ſhall rejoyce.</hi> But yet as a Woman, who in the Time of her Travel hath great ſorrow, but forgetteth all her Trouble and Pains as ſoon as ſhe is Delivered, for Joy that a Man-Child is born into the World: In like manner they ſhall be in Sorrow for a Time, but he will ſoon return to them again, and then their Sorrow ſhall be changed into Joy, which no Man can take away from them. The Apoſtles ſaw this prediction accompliſhed in a ſhort time after, for they bewailed his Death, while his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies rejoyced at it; but at the end of Three Days they were filled with Joy to ſee him riſen from the Dead, and the Jews were much aſhamed, and enraged to ſee him Worſhipped as a God, whom they had Crucified as a Vile Malefactor, and whoſe Memory they had endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh from the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>After this he promiſes them two things. The Firſt was, that after his Reſurrection he would nor ſpeak to them in Proverbs and Parables, as he had done hitherto, but would ſpeak to them plainly of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſhould need no explication, of what he ſhould ſay to them. The Second was, That they ſhould pray to the Father in his Name, which they had not yet done, and ſhould obtain whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they petition'd of him. At that time, ſaith he, ye ſhall ask in my Name, and I need not promiſe you, that I will pray my Father for you, for my Father himſelf Loveth you, becauſe ye have Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and have believed, that I am come from God: I am come, <hi>i. e.</hi> born eternally of God, and am come into the World; again I leave the World, and go unto my Father.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles thought that they underſtood theſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154149:114"/> laſt words perfectly, and therefore ſaid unto him, <hi>Now ſpeakeſt thou plainly, and ſpeakest no Proverbs.</hi> And for that reaſon believed, that he was come from God. He anſwered them, <hi>Ye now believe, but the Hour is coming, yea is already come, that ye ſhall be ſcattered, and ſhall leave me alone; but I am not alone, for my Father is with me: Theſe things have I ſaid unto you, that ye might have Peace in me; Ye ſhall have afflictions in the World, but be of good chear, I have overcome the World.</hi>

He alſo recommedns all thoſe to God, who ſhould believe in his Name thro' the Preaching of his Apoſtles, and prays for ſuch an Admirable Union among them, as makes all Chriſtians One, being united together in God by his Charity, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is in the Son, and Son, who is in the Father, are by one Nature. <hi>O Father,</hi> adds he, <hi>I pray that where I am, thoſe whom thou haſt given me, may alſo be, that they may behold my Glory.</hi> And he concludes this Admirable Prayer with theſe words, <hi>Holy Father the World hath not known thee, but I have known thee; theſe have known that I have ſent thee; I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it, that they may have that love among them, with which thou haſt loved me, and that I may be alſo my ſelf among them.</hi>

                  <p>Jeſus having finiſhed the former Prayer,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.36-46. Mark 14.26-42. Luke 22:39-46.

Jeſus then taking with him, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> began to be ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with fear, trouble, and grief, and ſaid unto them, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death, tarry ye here and watch with me.</hi> Then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from them about a Stones caſt, he threw himſelf upon the Earth; and as he was willing for the Conſolation of his Diſciples to endure all the Paſſions, which Nature ordinarily ſtirs up, at the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154149:115"/> approaches of Death, ſo he was deſirous by his Example to teach them what to do in that Eſtate. Thro' the voluntary perception of the infirmities of the fleſh, he Prayed his Father to ſave him from that Hour, wherein he had declared him to ſuffer Death; but thro' the Motion of a Spirit, full of Submiſſion and Charity, he corrected thoſe firſt Motions, and yielded entirely to the Will of his Father, ſaying, <hi>My Father, My Father, all things are poſſible with thee, remove this Cup from me; nevertheleſs not mine, but thy Will be done.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus prayed, he aroſe, and went to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whom he found aſleep, their Hearts being filled with ſorrow; wherefore ſpeaking to <hi>Peter,</hi> he reproved him, Simon <hi>ſleepest thou?</hi> and then he ſaid to all of them, <hi>What, could ye not Watch one hour with me? Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into Temptation: The Spirit is ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the fleſh is weak.</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Spirit would not be afraid of Death, and ye believe, that ye have ſtrength enough to contemn it; but the weakneſs of the fleſh makes ſuch a ſtrong reſiſtance againſt the Spirit, that it will eaſily conquer it, unleſs you beg the Divine grace to ſupport you againſt the fears of Death. Having ſaid thus, he returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Prayers, and ſaid to God, <hi>My Father, If this Cup may not paſs from me, unleſs I drink it, Thy Will be done.</hi> Then he returned again to his Diſciples, and finding them ſo ſleepy, that they knew not what to anſwer him, he went again to his Prayers a Third time. St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that there came an Angel from Heaven to him, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him, and that the Agony, in which he was, <hi>i. e.</hi> the conflict that he had in himſelf between the Fleſh, which diſſuaded him from ſuffering, and the Spirit, which was willing to ſubmit to the Will of God, cauſed ſuch a violent diſturbance in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154149:115"/> his Body, that there iſſued from it a Swet, which fell down to the Earth like drops of Blood.</p>
                  <p>Then he went a Third time to find his Apoſtles, and ſaying unto them by way of Reproof, and Irony, That they might <hi>now ſleep on and take their reſt,</hi> becauſe his time was come; He tells them in good earneſt, That the time was come that the Son of Man ſhall be delivered into the Hands of Sinners. Ariſe therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Let us go hence; behold he that betrayeth me is at hand.</hi>

                     <hi>Pilate</hi> could not be brought to put a Man to Death, in whom he found nothing worthy of Death; wherefore he called the Prieſts, Rulers and People, and told them, That having examined Jeſus before them, he did not find him guilty of any of thoſe Crimes of which they accuſed him; and that <hi>Herod,</hi> to whom he had ſent them, had paſſed the ſame Judgment: But to give place a little, to their Fury, becauſe he knew, that for Envy and Hatred, only, they had delivered him to him, he propounded it to them, to Scourge him, and then let him go again.</p>
                  <p>This not being liked, he contrived another way to ſave him: He was obliged by Cuſtom, upon the account of the Feaſt, to free a Criminal, whom the Jews would chuſe, and all the People, who deſired Jeſus Death, were alſo very earneſt with him, to ſhew them the ſame Favour he had always uſed to grant them. There was then in Priſon a

                  <p>Then did <hi>Pilate</hi> do all that he was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from the Hands of his Enemies; and this was the Reaſon that he propounded him with <hi>Barabbas</hi> to the People: But the Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders moved the People, and perſwaded them to require his Favour for <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and that Jeſus might be put to Death; ſo that when <hi>Pilate</hi> ask'd them a ſecond Time, Which of the Two they would have him releaſe to them? they all cryed out, <hi>Put this Man to death, and give us Barabbas.

                     <note place="margin">Matth. 27.57-66. Mark 15.42-47. Luke 23.50-56. John 19.38-42.</note> a City of <hi>Judaea,</hi> named <hi>Joſeph.</hi> It is true he was a Diſciple only in ſecret, becauſe he feared the Jews, but he was no way concerned in their Crime. And tho' he was one of the Rulers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he had not conſented at all to any thing that they had done againſt the Son of God. The Death of his Maſter filling him with more Courage, he went to <hi>Pilate</hi> and begged leave of him to take down the Body of Jeſus, and Bury it. <hi>Pilate</hi> could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that he was Dead ſo ſoon; but being aſſured of it by the Centurion, he gave his Body to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and Commanded it to be delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> then went and bought Linnen-Cloaths to Bury Jeſus in; and taking his Body down from the Croſs, wrapped it in them. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who came to Jeſus by Night, being deſirous to ſhare with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in paying theſe laſt Offices to their Maſter, brought a Mixture of Aloes and Myrrhe of about an Hundred Weight, and they two together wrapped up the Body of Jeſus in the Linnen with the Perfumes, and Buryed it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary Manner of the Jews. There was in the place where Jeſus was Crucified, a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and in it a Sepulchre, which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Hewn out of the Rock, wherein no Man was ever lay'd. Here they lay'd the Body of Jeſus, and went away, having rould a great Sone to the Mouth of the Sepulchre. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and the other Women, who were preſent at the Death of Jeſus, did alſo aſſiſt at his Burial, and took
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154149:125"/> notice where they laid him; and having conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on it they went and prepared Spices to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm him, as ſoon as the Sabboth-day, which was the next day, was over.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus being Dead, and Buryed on <hi>Fryday,</hi> the next day the Chief Prieſts and Phariſees went to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Sir we remember that that Deceiver, (for ſo they Term'd Jeſus) in his Life-time, ſaid that he would Riſe again in Three days after his Death: Command therefore, that his Sepulchre be kept under a Guard, till the Third Day, for fear his Diſciples ſhould come by Night and ſtealing away his Body, ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the People, that he is riſen from the Dead, and ſo they will fall into a new Error, worſe than the firſt. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye have a Guard, go, and do as ye will;</hi> ſo they went to the Sepulchre, Sealed it up, and ſet a Guard upon it.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154149:133"/> is entred by his Aſcenſion; for he told his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, That he went to prepare a Place for them:<note place="margin">John 14.3.</note> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, That he is entred into Heaven for us, as our Fore-runner,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.19, 20.</note> that we may follow him now in Hope; which ſerveth us as an Anchor, ſure and ſtedfaſt, in the various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances and Troubles of this Mortal Life.</p>
                  <p>As to the Life which Jeſus Chriſt now liveth in Heaven, the Goſpel tells us; That he ſits there,<note place="margin">Mark 16.19.</note> at the Right Hand of God. He ſiteth, <hi>i. e.</hi> is at perfect Eaſe and Reſt, having no more Trouble or Sufferings in his Sacred Humanity, to which he is united for our Salvation. He ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> is made equal with the Father, being God, of like Nature with him, and is raiſed up above all Creatures.</p>
                  <p>This Reſt,<note place="margin">Acts 7.56.</note> which Jeſus Chriſt enjoys for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hinders him not from acting for us; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he ſits at the Right Hand of God, S. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him there ſtanding indeed; ſince he came to the Earth, not only to purchaſe the Glorification of that Body and Soul which he aſſumed in the Womb of the Virgin, but alſo to obtain Salvation for all that believe on him: If he hath nothing elſe to do with his Sacred Humanity, yet it is his buſineſs to intercede for the Salvation of his Saints, till they ſhall come to be Partakers of his Glory.

                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note>Laſtly, 'tis there that he calls us, and invites us, to conſider upon him in his Glory, which he hath merited both for himſelf and us, by the Effuſion of his Blood, that by the Proſpect of that Eternal Happineſs, which he hath prepared for us, he may make us contemn all earthly Things, and ſtir us up to follow him in the Way he is gone before us, <hi>i. e.</hi> to imitate the Examples he hath given us, in this Mortal Life; of which we have related the Hiſtory in this Book.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us, by theſe Words, which include all the Benefit we ought to make of all that is ſaid of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.19-31.</note> 
                     <hi>We have freedom to enter with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the Heavenly Sanctuary, by the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ; going after him in that new Way which he hath trodden out for us in his own Fleſh: And, ſince he is in Heaven an High Prieſt, ſet over the Houſe of God, let us draw near to him with a truly ſincere Heart, and full of Faith, with a Soul puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the Filth of an Evil Conſcience, and a Body, preſerving the Purity which it hath received from the pure Water of Baptiſm; let us remain firm and ſtedfaſt in our Faith, and in the Hope of that Glory which he hath promiſed to us (for he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who hath promiſed:) And to obtain it, let us provoke one another to Love, and to good Works, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154149:134"/> let us encourage our ſelves ſo much the more, as we ſee the laſt Day draweth nigh; for if we ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, after we have received the Knowledge of Truth, we must expect nothing but the terrible Judgments, and the Flame of that Revenging and Rageing Fire, which ſhall conſume the Enemies of God. He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law was condemned to Death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy, how much greater Puniſhment doth he deſerve, think ye, who hath trodden under Foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, by which we are ſanctified, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy and Prophane Thing, i. e. who hath profaned, by Sin, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, by which he hath been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in Baptiſm, and who hath abuſed and affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of Grace; for we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance is reſerved for me, and I know how to repay it.

                     <hi>LIV.</hi> The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>This Living God, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, is the very ſame Perſon which we have ſeen in this Hiſtory, dying for the Salvation of Men, upon the Croſs: He was judged, but he ſhall judge us, and that by the Rules which he hath given us, and the Examples which he left us, in the Time of his Mortal Life: He lived ſubject to our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuffered Death, which is the Puniſhment of Sin; but he was raiſed in a State of Glory, and entred into the Poſſeſſion of Eternal Felicity: He was firſt of the ſame Nature with us, that we might one Day be as he is. If we imitate him in his Life and Death, we ſhall be like him in his Reſurrection and Glory; but we muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that Happineſs he now enjoys, if we do not go in the ſame Path he did, to attain it.</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:154149:135"/>
                  <p>By diſobeying his Laws, and not imitating his Actions, we not only renounce the Glory, to which he invites us, but bring upon our ſelves inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as well as everlaſting Torments; for there are but Two Ways, the one leads to Life, and the other to Death, and he that walks not in the firſt, muſt neceſſarily go into the ſecond. Jeſus Chriſt is himſelf the Way that leads to Heaven, and we go by him when we practiſe thoſe Truths which he hath taught, and regulate our Lives by the Pattern of his. To live otherwiſe than he lived, is not to follow him, but to wander, and deſtroy our ſelves; which we do not ſeriouſly enough conſider of. We do not examine our ſelves in which Way we are; we go on every Day in Ignorance, and when we come to the End of our Race, we find our ſelves on a Precipice, becauſe we have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Multitude, which ſecurely went before us, and guided us.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians therefore cannot do any thing more important, and conducing to their Salvation, than to meditate continually upon the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, and to look upon it as a Mirror, to diſcover the Blemiſhes and Faults of their own; they ought to account Jeſus Chriſt converſing on Earth, as our Guide and Light, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they do with what he hath done and taught, to acknowledge themſelves in a loſt Eſtate, and in Darkneſs, ſo long as our Converſation is not conformable to his Examples and Precepts. In Heaven they ought to eſteem Jeſus Chriſt as the End to which they continually aſpire, and which they labour daily to attain, that they may ſupport themſelves in all the Troubles and Difficulties which they met with in their Way thither, by the Contemplation of the Glory which he hath promiſed them. They ſhould, in the laſt Place, think always upon his Firſt and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:154149:135"/> Second Coming: They are inſtructed by his Firſt, what they muſt do to fit themſelves for his Second; and they ſhall be judged at his Second Coming, by the Precepts which they have received at his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. They will have no Excuſes to make for following the corrupt Cuſtoms, and Examples, and falſe Errors of the Ages they have lived in, when they come before that Judge, who hath told them, that he will judge them by the Doctrin he hath taught them himſelf, and by the Life he lived here, upon Earth, to be a Model of theirs.</p>
                  <p>That then we may appear before him with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that Great Day, when he will judge all Men, let us take the Advice which S. <hi>John,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple, gives us; <hi>My little Children,</hi>
